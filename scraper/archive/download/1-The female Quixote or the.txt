&U5 Behaviour of his Father, and the more 
^yflerious Words of his MifireB, gave Rife to. 
Amot^ many various Conje£hires, all equally 
vhreafbnahle, he fixed upon one, no way ad- 
vantageous to Sir Charhs ; for, fuppofing that 
the FoUy of Araffelk had really difgufted him, 
and made him defirous of breakii>g off the de- 
£gned Match between them ; he was, as he 
thought, taking Meafures to bri^g this about^ 
Juiowinff, that if X*ady Bella refufed to fulfil 
her Tamer's Defire in this Particular, a very 
confiderable Eftate would defcend to him. 
- Upon any other Occafion, Mr. Glanvilk 
vrould not have fufpedled his Father of fo un- 
generous an Adlion ; but Lovers think jevery 
thing poffible, which d^ey fear ^ and being pre* 
jpoflefied with this Opinion, he refolved the 
next Morning to found his Father's Inclina- 
tions, by intreating him to endeavour to pre- 
vail upon Lady Bella to marry him before her 
Year of Mourning for the Marquis' was ex- 
pired. 

Attending him, therefore^ at Breakfaft, in 
liis own Chamber^ he made his dedgned Re- 

Jueft, not without heedfully obferving his 
countenance at the fame time ; and trembling, 
left he {hould make him ah Anfwer, that 
might confirm his uneafy Sufpicion. 

Sir Charles^ however, agreeably furprifed

fome odd ways, yet, upon the Whole, flie is a

out any Offence to her DcKcacy, fhe may 
receive, may reform her ConduA ; and make 
her Behaviour as complete, as, it muft be 
cx^nfeiTed, both her Perfon and Mind now 
«re. 

Mr. Glanville having acquiefced in the Juf- 
tice of this Renlark, as foon as Breakfaft was 
over, went to vifit the two Ladies, who ge- 
nerally drank their Chocolate together. 

Mifs Glanville being then in Lady Bella's 
Apartment, he was immediately admitted^ 
where he found them engaged in a high Dis- 
pute ; and, much againft his Will, was obliged 
to be Arbitrator in the Affair, they having, up» 
on his Entrance, both appealed to him. 

But, in order to place this momentous Af- 
fair in a true Light, 'tis necefTary to go back a 
little, and acquaint the Reader with what had 
pafTed in the Apartment ; and alfo, following 
the Cuftom of the Romance and Novel- Wrir

No fooner were her fair Eyes open in the 
Morning, than the unfortnnate Sir George pre- 
fentinghimfelftoher Imagination, her Thoughts

tho* I do not intend to write to him, yet Til

not refill the Defire fhe had of talking upon a

Smile, that ihe was about to make a very 
charitable Vifit that Morning, aflced her, if 
ihe was difpofed to bear her Company m it> 

I know you Country Ladies, faid Mi& 
GlamAUiy are very fond of vifiting your fick 
Neighbours : For my Part, 1 do not love fuch 
a grave kind of Amufement i yet, for the fake 
of the Airihg, I ihall be very willing to attend 
you. 

I think, (aid Arabella^ with a noore ferious 
Air than before, it behoves every generous Pcr- 
(on to compaffionate the Misfortunes of their 
^Acquaintance and. Friends, and to relieve them 
as far as lies in their Power ; but thofe Miferies 
we ourfelves occafion to others, demand, in a 
more particular Manner, our Pity; and, if con- 
fident with Honour, our Relief. 

And pray, returned Mifs Glamnlli^ who is 
it you have done any Mifchief to, which yo/jk 
are to repair by this charitable Viilt^ as you 
call it?

The Mirchief I have done. rq)Iied Arahilb^ 
Mufihing, dnd cafting down her Eyes^ was not 
voluntary, I afiure you : Yet I will not fcruple 
to repair it, if t can y thoV flnce my Power r» 
confined by certain unavoidable Laws, my En- 
deavours may not haply have all the Succefs t 
could wiih. 

Well, but, dear Coufm, interrupted Mifs 
Glatmlli^ tell me in plain Engiifi^ what this 
Mifchief is, which you have done ; and to what 
Purpofe-you are going out this Morning ? 

I am going to pay a Vifit to ^\x Gtorgie Bill^ 
m9ar^ replied Jrabella; and I intreat you, fair 
Couiin, to pardon me for robbing you of fo 
aecomplifhed a Lover. I really always thought 
he was in Love with you, till I was undeceiv- 
ed by fome Words he fpoke Yeflerday ; and 
« Letter I received from him lafl Night, in 
which he has been bold enough to declare his 
Paffion to me, and, through the Apprehenfion 
of my Anger, is this Moment dying with 
Griof ; and ^tk to reconcile him to Life, that 
I have prevailed upon myfelf to make him a 
Vifit; in which charitable Defign, as I faid 
before, I ihould be glad of your Company. 

Mifi Glanvslky who believed not a Word 
Lady Btlla had faid, burft out a laughing, at a 
Speech, that appeared to her fo extremely falfe 
and ridiculous. 

1 fee, faid Arabella j you are of a Humour 
to divert yourfclf with the Miferies of a de- 
fpairing Lover ; and in this Particular, you 
greatly refemble the fair and witty Doralifa^ 
who always jefted at fuch Maladies as are oc-» 
caiioned by Love : However, this Infenfibility

does not bcconie'you fo well as ber^ fince 
ali her Coniii£t Was conformable to it, no Maii 
in the Worid being bold enough to talk to her 
«f Love ; but you, Cpufin, are ready, even by 
jFour own C6nfe£on, to liften to fuch DU^ 
courfes from any body ; and therefore this fie* 
baviour, in you, may be with more Juftice 
termed Levity, than Indifference, 
. I perceive, Coufin, faid Mifs Glanville, t 
have always the worft of thofe Comparifons 
you are pleafed to make between me and other 
People I but, I aiTure you, as free and indif- 
creet as you think me, I fliould very much 
icruple to vifit a Man, upon any Occafion 
whatever, 

I am quite aftonifhed, Mifs Glafwille, re- 
fumed ArabiUay to hear you afTume a Cha- 
raSer of fa much Severity ; you, who have 
granted Favours of a Kind in a very great De- 
gree criminal. « 

Favours ! interrupted Mife GlanviUe^ crimi^ 
nal Favours ! Pray explain yourfelf. Madam. 

Yes, Coufin, faid Arabella^ I repeat it again; 
criminal Favours, fuch as allowing Perfons to 
talk to yoQ of Love ; not forbidding them to 
write to you ; giving them Opportunities of 
being alone with you for feveral Moments to- 
gether; and feveral other Civilities of the like 
Nature, w^hich no Man can poilibly merit, un- 
der many Years Services, Fidelity, and Pains: 
All thefe are criminal Favoucs, and highly blame- 
able in a Lady, who has any Regard for her 
Reputation. 

All thefe, replied Mifs GAmt;///^, are no- 
thing in Compariibn of making them Vifits^ and 

no

no Woman, who has any Rq>utatioii at all, 
win be guilty of taking fach Liberties. 

What! Mifs, replied^ JrahnUa^ will you 
dare,, bf tfats Infiotiation,. to caft any Cenfure^ 
upoti tbe Virtue, of the divine MMtiimuiy the 
haughty Amaktxantha^ the fair Btattra^ the cold 
and rigid Parifatis^ and many other illuftrious 
LadieS^, who did not fcruple to rifit their Lo- 
vers, when confined to their Beds, either by 
the Wounds they received in- Battle, or the 
more cruel and dangerous ones they fuffered 
frem their Eyes ? Thefe chafie Ladies, who ne^ 
ver granted a Kifs of their Hand to a Lover, 
till he was upon the Point of being their Huf- 
band, would neverthelefs moft charitably con- 
defcend to approach their Bed-fide, and fpeaic 
A>m& compa^onate Words to them, in order 
to promote their Cure, and make them fubmir- 
to live ; nay, thefe divine Beauties would not' 
refufe to grant the fame Favour to Perfons 
whom they did not love, to prevent the fatal 
Confequence^ of their Defpair. 

Lord, Madam ! interrupted Mifs Glarvuille^^ 
I" wonder youxan talk fo blafphemoufly, to call 
a Parcel of confident Creatures divine, and' 
ffcich terrible. Words. 

Do you know, Mifs, {d\A Arabella^ with a' 
flern Look, that 'tis of the greateft PrinceiTes 
that ever were,, whom you fpeak in this irre-^ 
verent Manner ? Is it poifible, that you can be 
ignorant of the fublime Quality of Mandana^'^ 
who was the Heirefs of Two powerful King- 
doms ? Are you not fenfible, that Jtimlazdntha- 
was Queen of TMrringia ? And will you pre-

tend to deny the glorious ExtraSion of Statira 
and Pari/atiSy Princefles of Ptrjia f 

> I ihall not trpuhle myfelf to deny any thing 
about them. Madam, (aid Mifs Ghm/iile; for 
I never hoard of them before i and really I do 
Qot choefe to be always talking of Queens and 
.Princefles, as if I thought none but fuch great 
People were worthy my Notice : It looks fo 
affe6ied, I ihould im^ine every one laughed 
at me, that heard me. 

Since you are fo very fcrupulous, returned 
Arabella y that you dare not imitate the Sublimeft 
among Mortals, I can furnifli you with many 
Kxamples, from the Condud of Perfons, whofe 
Quality was not much fuperior to yours, which' 
may reconcile you to an A<S^ion, you at prefent, 
with fo little Reafon, condemn : And, to name 
but One among fome Thou&nds,' the fair Cleo^ 
mc€y the moft rigid and au{tere Beauty in all Sar» 
JiSy paid feveral Vifits to the paffionate Ligda* 
misy when his Melancholy, at the ill Succefs of 
his Paffion, threw him into a Fever, that coa- 
£ned him to his Bed. 

And pray. Madam, who was that Ckameef 
faidMiis Glanviile ; and where did fhe live ? 

In Sardh, I tttt you, faid Atahelloy in the 
Kingdom of Lydia. 

Ohl then it is not in our Kingdom, faid 
Mifs Glanv'dU: What fignifies what Foreigners 
do ? I (hall never form my Condud, upon the 
Example of Qutlandifli People 3 what is com* 
snon enough in their Countries, would be very 
fmrticuhr here; and you can never perfoade mc, 
that it is feemly for X^adies to pay Vifits ttf^.^ 
Mea in their Beds. 

ALady 



A Lady, faid ArUMla^ exmn^dy ^li^ry Ok 
her Coufm's Obftinacy; who will (Mfkt McM 
to prefs her Hand,' write to hef-, and^tiilk; to 
her of Lov^ ought to be albamed of fudi 2k% 
afibftcd Nicenefs, as that you pretend to. ^ 

I ihfift upon Its Madam^ faid WkGhm^ 
viik^ that all thofe innocent Liberties you rait 
at, may be taken by any Woman, without 
giving the World room to cerifure her : bu^j 
without being very bold and impudent, fbtf 
cannot go to fee Men in their Beds; a Free- 
dom that only becomes a Sifter, or near Re- 
lation. 

So thtti, replied Arabella, reddening witll 
Vexation, you will perfift in affirming the di- 
vine Mandana was impudent ? 

If flie paid fuch indifcrect Vifits as thofe, (he 
was, faid Mifs GianvilU, 

Oh Heavens ! cried Arabella^ have I lived 
to hear the moft illuftrious Princefs, that ever, 
was in the World, fo fhamefully reflected 
on ? 

Blefs me. Madam ! faid Mifs GlartviUe, what 
Reafon have you to defend the Charafter of 
this Princefs fo much ? She will hardly thank 
you for your Pains, 1 fanfy. 

Were you acquainted with the Charadler of 
diat moft generous Princefs, faid Arabella^ you 
would be convinced, that (he was fenfible of 
the fmalleft Benefits ; but it is not with a View 
of acquiring her Favour, that I defend her 
againft your inhuman Afperfions, fince it M

And this latter is your Opinion,, is^ it not

Well, replied Arahdlay I will content myfclf

Mr. Glanville, extremely pleafed that (he 
had laid afide her Defign of vifiting Sir George^ 
did not oppofe her writing to him, though he 
was plotting how to prevent the Letter reaching

for endeavouring to fupplanthim in his Coufin's

What then, faid . Mils Glanville^ do you 
really imagine Sir George is in Love with Lady

He is either in Love with her Perfon or

You may fee by his Letter, iatermpted Mifs

if you had heard how he talked to her the other

Blefs me. Madam, faid Mifs Glanvilki what 
horrid Things come into your Head ! I vow, 
you terrify me out of my Wits, to hear you. 

There is ho Occafion for your Fears, in- 
terrupted Arabella : Since we already Aifpedl his 
Defigns, it will be very eafy to prevent them : 
Had the Princefs of the ^Mrmatians -known the 
fatal Intentions of her defpairing Lover, doubt^ 
lefs, fhe would have ufed fome Precautions to 
hinder him from executing them ; for want of 
which, (he faw the miforable Agtlmond wel- 
tering in his Blood at her Feet ; ind with Rea- 
fon accufed herfelf of being theCauf^-gf fo 
deplorable a Speifitacle. 

The AftonijQiment Mifs GlawoilU was in, to 
hear her Coufin talk in this Manner, kept her 
from giving her any Interruption, while Ihc re- 
lated (everal other terrible Inftancesof Defpair. 

In the mean time, Sir George^ who was im- 
patient to go up to Lady Bella^s Apartment, 
having flattered himfelf with an Hope, that his 
Letter was favourably received j and that he 
jhould be permitted to hope at lead ; made a 
(hort Vifit to Sir Charles in his own Room ; and, 
accompanied by Mr. Glanvilley who was refolv- 
ed to- fee in what manner Arabella received 
him, went to her Apartment. 

As he had taken care, at his Entrance, to 
accommodate his Looks to the Character he 
had aflumed of an humble defpairing Lover, 
Arabella no fooner faw him, but her Counte- 
nance changed ; and, making a Sign to Mr« 
"GlanviUe^ who could not comprehend what 
the meant, to feize upon the Guard of his 
Sword, ihe bafiily ftept forward to meet him.

I am too well convinced, faid fhe to Sir

To-day, is to commit fome Violence againft

feech you, to the Di£(ates of your Defpair : 
Live; I command you, live; anc^fince you (ay^ 
I have the abfolute Difpofal of your Life, do 
not deprive yourfelf of it, without the Confent 
of her, on whom you profefs to have beftowed 
it. 

Sir George^ who did not imagine Arabella 
would communicate his Letter to her Coufins, 
and qAt expected fome diflant Hints from her 
concerrimg it, was fo confounded at this Re- 
ception before them, that he was not able to 
reply: He blufhed, and turned pale alternately; 
and, not daring to look, either upon Mifs Glan- 
vtlUy or her Brother, or to meet the Eyes of the 
fair Vifionary, who, with great Impatience, ex- 
pefted his Anfwer, he hung down his Head 
in averyfillyPofture; and, by his Silence, con- 
firmed Arabella in her Opinion. 

As he did not want for Wit and Aflurance, 
during that Interval of Silence, and Expecta- 
tion from all Parties ; his Imagination fuggefted 
to him the Means of extricating himfelf out of 
the ridiculous Perplexity he was in ; and as it 
concerned him greatly to avoid any Quarrel, 
with the Brother and Sifter, he determined to ' 
turn the whole Matter into a Jeft ; but, if pof- 
fible, to manage it fo, that Arabella (hould not 
enter into his Meaning. 

Raifmg therefore his Eyes, and looking upon 
Arabella with a melancholy Air 3

You are not deceived, Madam, faid he : This 
Criminal, with whom you are fo juftly offend- 
ed, comes with an Intention to die at your 
Feet, and breathe out his miferable Life, to ex- 
piate thofe Crimes of which you accufe him : 
But fince your fevere Compaffion will oblige 
me to live, I obey, oh ! moft divine, but cruel 
Jlrabella ! I obey your harfli Commands j and, 
by endeavouring to live, give you a more con- 
vincing Proof rf that Refpeft and Submiffion 
I (hall always have for yoor Will.

Obedience, I (hall not be lefs acknowleging 
riien the fair Parifatis ; but will have for you 
an Efteem equal to that Virtue I have ob- 
ferved in you. 

Sir George^ having received this gracious Pror 
mife, with a moft profound Bow, turned to 
Mr. Glanvilley with a kind of chafiened Smile 
upon his Countenance. 

And, you, fortunate and deferving Knight, 
faid he, happy in the Affeftions of the faire{l 
Perfon in the World ! grudge me not this fmall 
Alleviation of my Misfortunes ; and envy me 
not that Efteem, which alone is able to make 
me fuffer Life, while you pofTefs, in the Heart 
of the divine Arabella^ a Felicity that might 
be envied by the greateft Monarchs in the 
World. 

As diverting as this Scene was, Mr. Clan* 
ville was extremely uneafy : For though Sir 
George's Stratagem took, and he believed he

was. only indulging the Gaiety ofi)is Humour^ 
by carrying on this Farce ; yet he could not 
endure, he fhould divert himfelf at Arabella*^ 
Expence. The folemn Speech he had made him^ 
-did indeed force him tofm'de ; but he foon af* 
iumed a gra^r Look, and told Sir George^ \m. 
a low Voice, that when he had finifhed bif; 
Vifit, he fhould be glad to take a Turn with, 
him in the Garden* 

Sir George promifed to follow. him, and Mr^ 
Glstnville left the Room, and went into tba 
Gardens ; where the Baronet, having taken a 
refpeSful Leave of Arabella^ and, by a fly 
Glance, convinced Mifs Glanville^ he had fa-, 
crificed her Coufm to her Mirth, went to join 
her Brother. 

Mr. GlanviUe^ as foon as he (aw him, walk-. 
ed to meet him with a very refer ved Air : Which 
Sir George obferving, and being refolved to keep- 
..up his Humour; 

What, inhuman, but too happy Lover, faid 
he, what, am I to underftand by that Cloud

muft I, without any apparent Caufe, behold

though, without murmuring, I refign to him 
the adorable Arabella^ is yet refolved to dif- 
pute with me, a Satisfa£lion, which does not 
■deprive him of any Part of that glorious Fop*-.

The Conceffion I have required, is very fmall,

and makes her a fit Objefl: for your Ridicule^ 
and Contempt. 

You do Lady B^llay a mnch greater Injury 
than I do, replied Sir George^ by fuppofing, 
(he can ever be an Object of Ridicule and Con^ 
tempt: I think very highly of herUnderftand-

aiid therefore I beg you will not perfift in af-

threaten, I'll do what I can to content you ; but 
I muft quit my Heroics by Degrees, and fink 
with Decency into my own Chara<£ter ; other-

Finifhing thefe Words, (he left him with fo 
much Speed, that it would have been impof* 
fible for him to have ftopped her, though he 
had intended it : But indeed, he was fo loft in 
Wonder and Confufion at a Behaviour for 
which he was not able to aflign any other 
Caufe than Madnefs, that he remained fixed 
in the fame Pofture of Surprize, in which (he 
had left him ; andfrom which he was firft in- 
terrupted by the Voice of his Son, who, fee- 
ing Arabella flying towards the Houfe in great

I am forry, faid he, to find 3rou have fet 
your Heart upon this fantafiic Girl : If ever 
fixe be your Wife, which I very much doubt, 
ibe will make you very unhappy : But, Charles^ 
purfued he, I would advife you to think ito 
more of her ; content yourfelf with the Eftate 
you gain by her Refufal of you : With that Ad- 
dition to your own Fortune, you may pretend 
to any Lady whatever ; and you will find many 
that are full as agreeable as your Coufin, wha 
will be proud ofyour Addrefles. 

Inde^, Sir, faid Mr. GlanviUe^ with a Sig^, 
there is no Woman upon Earth whom I would 
choofe to marry^ but Lady Bella : I flattered 
myfelf, I had been happy enough to have made 
ibme Progrefs in her AfFe£Vion; but it feems, I 
was miftaken ; however, I ihould be glad to 
know, if (he gave you any Reafons for refufing 
me. 

Reafons ! faid Sir Charles : There is no mak- 
ing her hear Reafon, or exp€£lnig Reafon front 
her i I never knew fo ftrange a Woman in my 
Life : She would not allow me to fpeak what 
I intended concerning you; but interrupted me, 
every Moment, with fome high-flown &ufF or 
other. 

Then I have not loft all Hopes of her, cried 
Mr. GlanvilU eagerly \ for fince (he did not 
hear what you h^ to fay, (he could not pof- 
fibly deny you* 

But (he behaved in a very impertinent Man-

fal other Things, which, becaufe of her uncom* 
nion Style, I could not perfectly underftand ^ 
yet theyfeemed (hocking ; and, upon the Whole, 
treated me fo rudely, that I am determined to 
kave her to herfelf, and trouble my Head no 
more about her. 

For God's lake, dear Sir, faid Mr. Glan* 
vil/ej alarmed at this Refolution, fufpend your 
Anger, till I have feen my Coufin : There is 
fome Miftake, I am perfuaded, in all this. I 
know (he has fome very odd Humours, which 
you are not fo weU acquainted with, as 1 am, 
ril go to her, md prevad Bpon her to explain 
herfelf. 

You may do fo, if you pleafe, replied Sir 
Charles 'y but I fear it will be to very little Pur* 
pofe; for I redly fu(pe6t her Head is a little 
turned : I do not know what to xlo with her: 
It is not fit (he (hould have the Management of 
herfelf ; and yet 'tis impoffible to live upon eafy 
Terms with her. 

Mr. GlanviUe^ who did not doubt but Ara- 
hella hkd been guilty of fome very ridiculous 
Folly, offered nothing more in her Juftifica* 
-tion ; but, having attended his Father to his own 
Chamber went to Arabella's Apartment. 

He foui>d the penftve Fair-one, in a melan- 
choly Pofture, her Head reclined upon one 
of her fair Hands ; and though her Eyes were 
fixed upon a Book (he held in the other, yet 
ihe did not feem to read, but Tather to be 
wholly buried in Contemplation. 

Mr. Glanville having fo happily found her 
alone {for her Women were not then in her 
Chamber) feated himfelf near her ^ having firft

afked Pardon for the Interruption he had given 
to her Studies ; and Arahelloy throwing afide her 
Book, prepared to liften to his Difcourfe ; 
which by the Agitation, which appeared in 
Looks, {he imagined, would be upon fbme 
extraordinary Subject, 

I left my Father juft now, faid he, in a 
great deal of Uneafinefs, on account of fome- 
thing you faid to him. Lady Bella : He ap- 
prehends you are difobliged, and he would 
willingly know how. 

Has your Father then acquainted you with 
the Subjeft of our Converfation ? interrupted 
Arabella. 

I know what would have been the Subject of 
your Converfation, replied Mr. Ghnville^ if 
you had been pleafed to liflen to what Sir 
Charles intended to fay to you on my Be- 
half. 

On your Behalf? interrupted Arahellq: Ah 
poor deceived Glanville ! how I pity thy blind 
Sincerity ! But it is not for mc to undeceive 
thee : Only thus much I muft fay to you. Beware 
of committing yourlnterefts to a Perfon, who 
will be a much better Advocate for another 
than for you. 

Mr. Glanvillej rejoiced to find by thefe 
Words, that her Refentment againft his Fa- 
ther was occafioned by a Sufpicion fo favour- 
able for him, affured her, that Sir Charles 
wiflied for nothing more earneftly, than that he 
might be able to merit her Efteem ; and that 
it was to difpofe her to liffen to his Addrefles, 
that he wanted to difcourfe with her that Morn- 
ing.

Mr. Glanvilley being obliged, through his 
Knowlege of his Coufin's Temper, to fpeak 
to her in this diftant Manner, went on with 
his Aflurances of his Father's Candour in this 
Refpeil ; and Jrahella^ who would not de- 
clare her Reafons for doubting it, only replied. 
That flie wiflied Sir Charles meant all that he 
had faid to him \ but that (he could not per- 
fuade herfelf to believe him fmcere, till his fu- 
ture A£lions had convinced her he was fo. 

Mr. Glanvilky impatient to let his Father 
know, how greatly he had been miftaken in 
the Caufe of Arabella^ % Behaviour, made his 
Vifit Ihorter than he would. otherwife have done, 
in order to undeceive him. 

Is it poflible, faid Sir Charles^ when his Son 
had repeated the Converfation he had juft had 
with Arabella^, that (he could be fo foolifli, a$ 
to imagine, I had a Defign fo propofe any one 
elfe to her but you ? What Reafon have I ever 
given her, to think I would not be glad to 
have her for my Daughter-in-law f Indeed, 
(he has fome odd Ways that are very difagree- 
able; but (he is one of the bed Matches in 
England for 2l]1 that: Poor Girl! purfued he, 
fhe had Reafon to be angry, if that was the 
Cafe ; and now I remember, flie cried, when 
I told her I would leave the Houfe ; yet her 
Spirit was fo great, that fhe told me, I might 
go. Well, I'll go and make it up with her ; 
but who could have imagined, fhe would have 
been fo foolifh ? Sir Charles^ at the Repetition 
of thefe Words, hurried away to Arabella's

to afk you Pardon, for havif^ led jou into a

'Tis enough. Sir, interrupted Arab€lla\ I grant 
you my Pardon for what is paft; and as it does not 
become me to receive Submiffions from my 
Uncle, while be remembers he is fo, I will dif- 
penfe with your Acknowlcgements at prefent r 
Only to convince me, that this fndden Altera-

I proieft, cried Sir Charles^ that I never in-

I will not bear you fay a Word more of your 
paft Intentions, interrupted Arabella again : I 
have forgot them all ; and, while you con- 
tinue to regard me as your Niece, I will ne- 
ver remember them to your Dtfadvantage. 

Then I may hope, faid Sir Charles — 

Oh ! Heavens ! cried Arabella^ not fuffering 
him to proceed ; do you come to infiilt me 
thus, wiih a mock Repentance ? And has my 
Ealinefs, in being fo ready to forget the In- 
jury you would have done me, made you pre- 
fiimptuous enough to cheriih an indent Hope 
that I will ever change my Rcfolution ? 

How vexatious is this ! replied Sir Charles^ 
fretting to fee her continually miftaking him» 
I fwear to you, by all that is facred, that 'tis 
my Son, for whom I would folicrt your Con- 
fent. 

How ! faid Arabella^ aftoniflied, Will you 
then be juft at laft ? And can you refolve to 
plead for that Son, whofe Intereft, but a Mo^

Chap.^. Q^UIXOTE. 41 

I fee, fald Sir Charles^ it is impoffible to 
convince you. 

No, no interrupted Ardhella^ haftily ; it is 
not impoiliBle but my own ardent Wiflies that 
.. it may be fo, will help to convince me of the 
Truth of vrhat you fay : For in fine,, do you 
think, I {hall not be as glad as yourfelf, to find 
you capable of adling honourably by your Son ; 
and to fee myfelf no longer the Caufe. of the 
moft unjuftifiable Condu^ imaginable ? 

Sir Charles was opening his Mouth, to prefs

withftanding her ftrange Behaviour, he was 
glad to 'find, (he loved \ wheA Arabslla pre- 
•venting him,

LADY Bella having recovered her ufual

kit at her Uncle's returning to Reafon, and 
the Abatement (he perceived in Sir Georgeh 
extreme Melancholy, mixed in the Converfa-

mexnbred any of her foimer Extravagancies. 

Mr. Glanville gazed on her with a paflionate 
Tendernefs, Sir George with Admiration, and 
the old Baronet with Wonder and Delight. 

But Mifs Glanville^ who was inwardly vexed 
at the Superiority her Coufm's Wit gave her 
over herfelf, wiflied for nothing more than an 
Opportunity of interrupting a Converfation in 
which fhe could have no Share ; and, willing 
to put them in mind of fome of Arabella's 
ftrange Notions, when fhe obferved them

Mr. Gtam/iiU, horridly vexed at a Queftion 
that was likely to engage Arabella in a Difcourfe 
very different from that (he had been fo capa- 
ble of pleafing in, frowned very intelligibly at 
his Sifter ; and, to prevent any Anfwcr being 
given to her abfurd Demand, direfted fome 
other Converfation to Arabella : But {he, who 
faw a favourite Subject ftarted, took no Notice 
of what Mr. GlanviUe was faying to her 5 but, 
direfting her Looks to Sir George^ 

Though Mifs Glanviilej faid (he, be a littte 
xniftaken in the Name of that fair Queen (he 
has mentioned ; . yet I am perfuaded yOu know 
whom (he means ; and that it is the renowned 
Tbalejirisj whofe Valour daggers herBelief, 
and of whom (he wants to be informed. 

Ay, ay, thalejirisy fiid Mifs GlanvUle : It 
$8 fuch a ftrange Name I could not remember 
it ; but, pray, was there ever fuch a Perfon ? 

Certainly, Madam, there was, replied Sir 
George : She was Queen of the Amazons^ z wai> 
like Nation of Women, who poffeffed great 
Part of Cappadocia^ and extended their Con- 
quefts fo far, that they became formidable to 
all their Neighbours. 

You find, Mifs, faid Arabella^ I did not at- 
tempt to impofe upon you, when I told you 
of the admirable Valour of that beautiful 
Queen ; which indeed was fo great, that the 
united Princes, in whofe Caule (he fought, 
looked upon her Afliftance to be equal to that 
of a whole Army ; and they honoured her, 
accordinglv, with the moft diftingui(hing Marks 
of their Efteem and Acknowlegement, and 
offered her the chief Command of their Forces.

never was fuch a thing heard of in the World. 

What, Sir, faid ArahtUa^ will you contradict 
a Fad attefted by the greateft Hiftorians that

' there never were fiich Perfons as Oroondates or 
Juba^ as difpute the Exiftence of the famous >

Why, pray, Madam^ faid Sir Charles ^ who- 
' were thofe ? 

One of them, replied Jr^bilky was the 
l^eat King of Scythia \ and the others Prince 
of the Two AtmtritanUs. 

Ods- heart I interrupted Sir Charlts^ I believe 
their Kingdoms are in the Moon : I never heard 
of Scytbia^ or the Two Mauritanias^ before. 

And yet. Sir, I'eplied Ar^Mla^ thofe King« 
doms are doubtlefs as well known, as Pranct

1 muft confefs, faid Sir Gnrge^ I have a 
▼cry great Admiration for thofe Two renowned 
Princes, and have read their beautiful Exploits 
with infinite Pleafure ; notwithftanding which, 
I am more inclined to efteem the great Arta- 
kaHy then either of them.

Queftion, a Warrior equal to either of them*

your Partiality proceeds from another Caufe ; 
and you having the Honour to refemble him in 
"Tome little Infidelities he was accufed of, with

Arabella bluflied when (he ended thefe

I have, indeed, the Honour, Madam, to re- 
femble the great Artaban^ in having dared to 
rfufe my Thoughts tqwards a Divine Perfon, 
Dirho, with Reafon, condemns my Adorations. 

Hey-day ! cried Sir Charles^ are you going 
to fpei^ic of Divine Things, after all the Fables 
you have been talking of ? Troth, I love to 
faear young Men enter upon fuch Subjedts : But 
pray, Niece, who told you Sir George was an 
Infidel ? 

Mr. GJawoillej replied Arabella : And I am 
inclined to thinir he fpoke Truth ; for Sir 
George has never pretended to deny it. 

How 1 interrupted Sir Charles ; I am forry 
to hear that. 1 hope you have never, added 
he, looking at the young Baronet, endea** 
voured to corrupt my Son with any of your 
Free-thinking Principles : I am for every 
body haying Liberty of Confcience $ but I 
cannot endure to hear People of your Stamp 
endeavouring to propagate your mificbievous

your own future Happinefs, difturbing other

46 r^^e FEMALE BookV. 

I do not imagine his Hiftory is fit to be beard 
by Ladies, faid Sir Charles ; for your Infidels 
live a ftrange kind of Life. 

However that may be, replied Arahellay we 
muft not difpenfe with Sir George from per- 
forming his Promife : I dare fay there are no 
Ladies here, who will think the worfe of him 
for freely confeffing his Faults. 

You may anfwer for yourfelf, if you pleafe. 
Madam, faid Sir Charles y but I hope my Girl 
there, will not fay as much. 

I dare fay my Coufin is not fo rigid, faid 
Arabella : She has too much the Spirit of Ju- 
lia in her^ to find Fault with a little Infidelity. 

I am always obliged to you for your Com- 
parifons, Coufin, faid Mifs Glanville : I fup* 
pofe this is greatly to my Advantage too. 

laffureyou, Madam, faid Sir G^^r^^, Lady 
Bella has done you no Injury by the Compari- 
fon (he has juft now made ; for Julia was one 
of the fineft Princefles in the World. 

Yet {he was not free from the Sufpicion of 
Infidelity, replied Arabella ; but though I do 
not pretend to tax my Coufin with that Faulty 
yet it is with a great deal of Reafon that I fay

I was never thought to be ill-humoured in

louring ; and I cannot imagine what Reafon I 
have given you for faying I am. 

Nay, Coufin, faid Arabella^ I am not con- 
detnning your Humour ; for, to fay the Truth, 
there are a great many Charms in a volatile

Clfopatra ! cried Sir Charles : Why (he was 
a^Sypfey, was fhe not ? 

I never heard her called fo, faid Arabella^ 
gravely ; and I am apt to believe you are not at 
all acquainted with her : But pray, purfued (he, 
let us wave this Difcourfe at prefent, and pre- 
pare to liften to Sir G gorge* % Relation of his 
Life ; which, I dare fay, is full of very extra- 
ordinary Events : However, Sir, added (he, di- 
refting her Speech to the young Baronetj I am 
afraid your Modefty will induce you to fpeak 
with lefs Candour than you ought, of thofe 
great Adions, which queftionlefs you have per- 
formed : Therefore we fhall hear your Hiftory, 
with greater Satisfadlion, from the Mouth of 
your faithful 'Squire, who will not have the 
iame Reafons that you have, for fuppreffing 
what is moft admirable in the Adventure^ of 
your Life. 

Since it is your Pleafure, Madam, replied 
Sir George^ to hear my Adventures, I will re- 
count them as well as I am able myfelf, to 
the end that I may have an Opportunity of 
obliging you bjr doing fome Violence to my na- 
tural Modefty, which will not fuffer me to re- 
late Things the World have been pleafed to

SHOUGH at prcftnt. Madam, 
I you behold me in the Quality of a 
. private Gentleman, in the PofTef- 
I fion only of a tolerable Eftate 
t yet my Birth is iliuArious enough 
My Ancellors having formerly worn a Crown 
which, as they won by their Valour, fo they loft

How, interrupted Sir Cbarksy are you de- 
fcended from Kings ? Why, I never heard you 
i'ay fo before : Pray, Sir, how far are you re-- 
moved from Royal Blood I and which of your 
Forefathers was it that wore a Crown ? 

Sir, replied Sir George^ it is not much more 
than Eight hundred Years fmce my Anceftors, 
who were Saxons ^ fwaved the Sceptre of Kent ; 
und from the firft Monarch of that mighty 
Kingdom, am I Hneally defcended. 

Pray where may that Kingdom of Kent lie ? 
faid Sir Charles. 

In replied Sir George, 

A mighty Kingdom indeed ! faid Sir Charles : 
Why, it makes but a very final! Part of the.King- 
dom of Britain now : Well, if your An- 
ceftors were Kings of that County as it is now 
called, it muft be confefTcd their Dominions 
were very fmall. 

' However that may be, faid Arabella ^ it raifes 
Sir George greatly i(i my £fteem, to hear he is 
defcended from Kings ; for, truly, a Royal Ex- 
tra Aion does infinitely fet off noble and valiant 
AiSions, and infpircs only lofty and generous 
Sentiments : Therefore, illuftrious Prince (for 
in that Light I (hall always confider you), be 
aflured, though Fortune has defpoiled you of 
your Dominions, yet fmce (he cannot deprive 
you of your Courage and Virtue, Providence 
will one Day aifift your noble Endeavours to 
recover your Rights, and place you upon the

to which you was born. 

For Heaven's fake. Niece, faid Sir Charles^ 
EIow come fuch improbable Things into your 
Head ? Is it fucli an eafy Matter, think you, to 
conquer Kingdoms, that you can flatter a young 
Man, who ha& neither Fleets nor Armies, with 
iuch ftrange' Hopes ? 

The great Jriaban^ Sir, refumed Arabella^ 
had neither Fleets nor Armies, and was Mailer 
only of a ilngle Sword ; yet he foon faw him- 
felf greater than any King, difpofing the De- 
ftinies of Monarchs by his Will, and deciding 
the Fates of Empires by ^a (ingle Word : But 
pray let this Difpute reft where it is, and per- 
mit Sir George to continue his Relation. 

It is not necefiary. Madam, refumed Sir 
George^ to acquaint you with the Misfortunes 
of my Family, or relate the feveral Progref- 
fions it made towards the private Condition in 
which it now is : For, bcfides that reciting the 
Events of fo many Hundred Years may haply, 
in feme meafure, try your Patience, I fliould 
fcc'glad if you would difpenfc with me from 
entering into a Detail of Accidents that would 
fenfiWy afflift me : Itfliall fuffice, therefore, to 
inform you, that my Father, being a peaceable 
Man^ Ibnd of Retirement and Tranquillity, 
made no Attempts to recover the Sovereignty 
from which his Anceftors had been gnjuftly 
expelled ; but quietly beheld the Kingdom of 
Kent in the Poffeffion of other Matters, while 
he contented himfelf with the Improvement of 
ihat fmall Pittance of Ground, which was all

that the unhappy Prince Veridamer^ my Grande- 
father^ was able to bequeath to him. 

Hey-day ! cried Sir Charles^ Will you new- 
chriften your Grandfather, when he has been 
in his Grav^ thefe Forty Years ? I knew ho- 
neft Sir Edmard Bellmour very well, though I 
was but a Youth when he died ; but I be- 
lieve no Perfon in Kent ever gave him the 
Title of Prince Veridomer : Fie ! fie ! thefe are 
idle Brags. 

Sir George^ without taking Notice of the old 
Baronet's Heat, went on with his Narration in 
this manner : 

•Things were in this State, Madam, when I 
was born. I will not trouble you with the 
Relation of what 1 did in my Infancy. 

No, pray (kip over all that, interrupted Sir 
Charles ; 1 fuppofe your Infancy was like other 
Peoples? What can there be worth hearing in 
that ? 

You are deceived. Sir, (dXi Arabella : ^ht 
Infancy of illuftrious Perfonages has always 
fomething very extraordinary in it j and from 
itheir childifh Words and Adions there have 
been often Prefages drawn of their future 
Greatnefs and Glory. 

Not to difoblige Sir Charles^ however, faid 
the young Prince of Kent^ I will not repeat 
many things, which I faid and did in the firft 
Yeais of my Life, that ihofe about me thought 
very furprifing ; and from them prognofti- 
cated, that very ftrange Accidents would befa} 
me. 

I have been a Witnefs of fome very unfa- 
vourable Prognoftics of you^ faid Sir Charles^

fmiling ; for you was the moft unlucky bold 
Spark, that ever I knew in my Life. 

'TIs very certain, purfued Sir George^ that the 
Forwardnefs of ray Spirit gave great Uneafinefs 
to my Father; who, being, as Ifaid before, in- 
clinable to a peaceable and fedentary Life, en- 
deavoured as much as poilible to reprefs that 
Vivacity in my Difpofition, which he feared 
might involve me in dangerous Enterprizes. 
The Pains he took in my Education, I re- 
compenfed by a more than ordinary Docility ^ 
and, before I was Thirteen, performed all my 
Exercifes with a marvelous Grace \ and, if I 
may dare fay fo, was, at thofe early Years, the 
Admiration and Wonder of all that faw me. 

Lady Bella had fome Reafon to fear your 
Modefty, I find, faid Sir Charles^ {miling ^ for, 
methinks you really fpeak too (lightly of your 
Excellencies. 

Howeverxthat may be, rcfumed Sir George \ 
my Father faw thefe early Inftances of a tower- 
ing Genius in me, with a Pleafure, chaftencd 
by his Fears, that the Grandeur of my Courage 
would lead me to attempt ibmething fpr the 
Recovery of that Kingdom, which was my 
Due > and which might haply occafion bis lofing 
me. 

Poffeffed with thefe Thoughts, he carefully 
avoided faying any thing to me concerning the 
glorious Pretences, to which my Birth gave me 
a Right J and often wifhed it had been poflible 
for him to conceal from me, that I was the 
true and lawful Heir of the Kingdom oiKmt ; 
a Circumftance he never chofe to mention to

any Perfon, and would have been glad, if it 
l>ad always remained a Secret. 

And fo it was a, Secret, interrupted Sir 
Charles ; for, till this Day, I never heard of it ; 
4nd It might ftill have been a Secret, if you had 
plcafcd ; for nobody, I dare fay, would fufpeft 
fucli a Thing j and very few, I believe, will 
be inclined to think there is any thing in fuch 
nn improbable Tale. 

Noiwiihftrinding all my Father's Endeavours 
tn thf contrary, Madam, purfucd Sir George^ 
1 ilirriflicd thoCc towering Sentiments, the 
Knuwlr^^c of my I^irth infpired me with 5 and 
It wrt^ not withuut the utmoft Impatience, that 
i hh'ftkcd the pnvute Condition, to which I 
\\^v\\\\ tnyfrit icilurcd.

»Mif rntMigh to deprive me of that Kingdom,

ami iit^lurloiti State; but, to make that Condi* 
Itttn lotinifcly more grievous, muft thou ^'ve

Nubinlllioni I mud pay to thofe, who triumph 
in tho Spoils of my ruined Houfe ? A Soul, 
which frrfi nothing above its Hopes and £x- 
)HiM4(uinh ? And| in fine, a Soul, that excites 
i\\\i drtily to attempt Things worthy of my 
Mirthi ttnd thofe noble Sentiments I inherit 
\\K\\\\ my great Forefathers? Ah! purfued I,, 
unhappy BtUm9ur\ what hinders thee from 
makiny; thyfcif known and acknowleged for 
vh4t thou art ? What hinders thee from bold- 
ly ailhting thy juft and natural Rights ; and

from defying the Ufurper, who detains them 
from thee ? What hinders thee, I foy ? 

What ? Interrupted Sir Charles^ why the 
Fear of a Halter, I fuppofe : There is nothing 
more eafy than to anfwer that Qucftion. 

Such, Madam, faid Sir George^ were the 
Thoughts, which continually difturbed my 
Imagination ; and, doubtlefs, they had not fail- 
ed to puih me on to fome hazardous Enter- 
prize, bad not a &tal Paflion interpofed ; and 
by its fweet, but dangerous Allurements, 
ftifled for a while that Flame, which Ambi- 
tion, and the Lov.e of Glory, kindled in my 
Soul. 

Sir George here pauGng, and fixing his Eyes 
with a melancholy Air on the Ground, as if 
preft with a tender Remembrance; 

Mr. Glanville alked him, fimiling, If the 
Thoughts of poor Dolly difturbed him ? Pray, 
added he, give us the Hiffory of your firft 
Love, without any Mixture of Fable ; or fhall 
I take the Trouble off you ? For you know, I 
am very well acquainted with your Affair with 
the pretty Milk- maid, and can tell it very fuc- 
cin<£Uy. 

*Tis true. Sir, faid Sir George^ fighing, I 
cannot recall the Idea of Dorothea ^ into my 
Remembrance, without fome Pain : That fair, 
but unfaithful Shepherdefs, who iirft taught me 
to %h, and repaid my Tendernefs with the 
hlackeff Infidelity : Yet I M/ill endeavour tp- 
compofe myfelf, and go on with my Narra- 
tion. 

. Be pleafed to know then. Madam, purfued^ 
Sir Georgey that having my Thoughts, in this- 

i> 4. . -^ manner,, 



56 Tbe FEMALE Book VI. 

manner, wholly employed with the Difaftersr 
of my Family, I had arrived to my feventeentb 
Year, without being fenfible of the Power of 
I^ove; but the Moment now arrived, which 
was to prove fatal to my Liberty. Following 
the Chace one Day with my Father ^ and fome 
other Gentlemen, I happened to lag a little be- 
hind them ; and, being taken up with my ordi- 
nary Refledions, I loft my Way, and wander- 
ed a long time, without knowing or confider- 
ing whither I was going. Chance at laft con- 
du£led me to a pleafant Valley, furrounded 
with Trees ; and, being tired with riding, I 
lighted, and tying my Horfe to a Tree, walked 
forward, with an Intention to repofe myfelf a 
few Moments under the Shade of one of thofer 
Trees, that had attraftcd my Obfervation : But 
while I was looking for the moft convenient 
Place, I fpied, at the Diftance of fome few 
Yards from me, a Woman lying afleep upon 
tlie Grafs : ^Curiofity tempted me to go nearer 
this Perfon; and, advancing foftly, that I 
might not difturb her, I got near enough to 
have a View of her Perfon : But, ah ! Hea- 
vens ! what Wonders did my Eyes encounter 
iji this View ! —The Age of this fair Sleeper 
feemed not to exceed Sixteen ; her Shape was 
formed with the exadeft Symmetry ; one of her 
Handd fupported her Head; the other, as it 
lay carelefly ftretched at her Side, gave me an 
Opportunity of admiring its admirable Colour 
and Proportion : The thin Covering upon her 
Neck difcovcred Part of its inimitable Beauty 
to my Eyes ; hut her Face, her lovely Face, 
fixed all my Attention* 

Ceruin ' 



Chap. I. QUIXOTE. sj 

Certain it is, Madam, that, out of this Com-^ 
pany, it would be hard to iincf any thing fo 
p^rk&y as what I now viewed. Her Com* 
ple^cion was the pureft White imaginable, 
heightened by the inchanting Glow, which 
dyed her fair Cheeks with a Colour like that 
of a new-blown Rofe: Her Lips, formed with 
the greateft Perfe£lion, and of a deeper Red, 
feemed to receive new Beauties from the Fra* 
grance of that Breath, that parted from them : 
Her auburn Hair fell in loofe Ringlets over her 
Neck y and fome ftraggling Curls, that played 
upon her fair Forehead, fet off by a charming 
Contrail the Whitnefs of that Skin it partly 
hid : Her Eyes indeed were clofed ; and though 
I knew not whether their Colour and Beauty 
were equal to thofe other Miracles in her Face, 
yet their Proportion feemed to be large; and 
the fnowy Ljds, which covered them, were 
admirably fet ofF by thofe long and fable Lafhes 
that adorned them. 

For fome Moments I gazed upon thfe love- 
ly Sleeper, wholly loft in Wonder and Admira* 
•lion. 

Where, whifpered I, where has this Miracle 
been concealed, that my Eyes were never blef- 
fed with the Sight of her before ? Thefe Word^, 
though L uttered them foftly, and with the 
utmoft Caution ; yet by the murmuring Noife 
they made, caufed an Emotion in the beauteous 
Sleeper, that fbe ftarted, and prefently after 
opened het Eyes : But what Words fhall I find 
• to exprcfe the Wonder, the Aftonifliment, and 
Rapture, which the Sight of thofe bright Stars 
mfpired me with i The Flames which darted

j$ rbe FEMALE Book VI. 

from thofe glorious Orbs, caft fucb a dazling 
Splendor upon a Sight too weak to bear a 
Radiance fo unufual, that, ftepping back a few 
Paces, I contemplated at a Diftance, that 
' Brightneis, which began already to kindle a 
confuming Fire in my Soul. 

Blefs me \ interrupted Sir Charles^ con^ 
founded at fo pompous a Defcriptbn ; who* 
could this be ? 

The pretty Milk-maid, Dolly Acorn^ replied 
Mr. GlanvilU gravely ; Did you never fee her^ 

Sir, when you was at your Seat, at I 

She ufed often to bring Cream to my Lady. 

Aye, aye, replied Sir Char Us y I remember 
hex : She was a very pretty Girl ; And fo it was^ 
from her Eyes, that aU thofe Splendors and 
Flames came, that had like to have burnt yoa 
up, Sir Georgt : Well, well, I guefs how the 
Story will end : Pray let us hear it out. 

I have already told you, Madam^ refumed 
Sir George^ the- marvelous Efle£k the Sight of 
thofe bright Eyes produced upon my Spirit : £ 
remained fixed in a Pofture of Afionifhment 
and Delight ; and all the Faculties of my Soul 
yftxt fo abforbed in the Contemplation of the 
JVliracles before me, that I believe, had (he. 
i\\\\ continued before ray Eyes, I fliould never 
' have moved from the Place where 1 thenftood : 
But the fair Virgin, who bad fpied me at the 
fmal) Diftance to which 1 was retired, turned 
haftily about, and fiew away with extraordi* 
nary Swiftnefs. 

When Love, now lending me Wings, whonx 
Admiration had before made motionlefs, I per- 
iued her fo eagerly^ that at laft I overtook her^ 

and. 



Chap, r; QUXXOTE. f^ 

and, throwing myfelf upon my Knees before* 
her, 

Stay, I conjure you, cried I; and if you be 
a Divinity, as your celeilial Beauty makes me 
believe, do not refufe the Adoration I offer 
.you : But if, as I moft ardently wifh,^ you are* 
a Mortal, though fure the faireft that ever 
graced the Earth ; ftop a Moment^ to look up- 
on a Man, whofe Refpe£fe for you as a Mor-* 
tal fell little fhor* of thofe Adorations he of- 
fers you as a Goddefs.. 

I can't but think, cried Sir Charhf^ laughing^ 
how poor Dolly muft be furprifed at fuch a rho- 
domontade Speech ! 

Oh, Sir! replied Mr. GlanvilU, you will 
find {he will make as good a one. 

Will flie, by my Troth, faid Sir Charles: t 
don't know how to* believe it. 

This Aftion, purfued Sir G^orge^ and the 
Words I uttered, a little furprifed that fair 
Maid, and brought a Blufli into her lovely 
Checks j but, recovering herfelf, Ihe replied 
with an admirable Grace, 

I am no Divinity, faid flie y- and' therefore 
youf Adorations are mifplaccd : But if, as you 
^. fey, my Countenance moves you to any Re- 
fpeft for mCy give me a Proof of it, by nor 
endeavouring to hold any further Difcourf<3 
with me, which is not permitted inc from 6ne 
«f your Sex and Appearance. 

A very wife Anfwer, indeed ! interrupted 
Sir Charles again : Very few Town Ladies 
would have difclaimed the Title of Goddefs, if 
ibeir Lovers had thought proper to bellow it

upon theni. I am mightily pleafed with the Girl 
for her Ingenuity. 

The Difcretion of fo young a Damfel, re- 
fumed Sir George^ charmed me no lefs than her 
Beauty; and I befought her, with the iitmoft 
Earneftnefs, to permit me a longer Converfa- 
tion with her. 

F^ear not, lovely Virgin, faid I, to liflen to 
the Vows of a. Man, who, till he faw you, 
neVfer learnt to figh : My Heart, which de- 
fended its Liberty againft the Charms of many 
admirable Ladies, yields, without Relu£bnce, 
to the pleating Violence your ficauties )ay 
upon me. Yes, too charming and dangerous 
Stranger, I am no longer my own Mafter : It 
is in your Power to difpofe of my Deftiny : 
Confider therefore, I befeech you, whether you 
can confent to fee me die t For I fwear to 
you, by the moft facred Oaths,, unlefs you pro- 
mi fe to have fome Compaffion on me, I wilt 
no longer behold the Light of Day. 

You may eafily conceive, Madam, that, conr 
fidering this lovely Makl in the Chara£^er of 
a Shepherdefs, in which fhe appeared, I made 
her a Declaration of my Paffion, without think- 
ing myfelf obliged to obferve thofe Refpeds, 
which, to aPerfon cf equal Rank with myfelf 
Decorum would not have permitted me to for- 
get. 

However, {be repelled my Boldnefe with 
fo charming a Modefty, that I began to be- 
lieve, (he might be a Perfon of illuftrious Birth, 
difguifed under the mean Habit ihe wore : But, 
having requefiecj her to inform me who (he was, 
ihe told me, her Name was Dorotbia\ and that 

■ Ihe 



Chap. r. QUIXOTE. 6i 

(he was Daughter to a Farmer, that lived in 
the neighbouring Valley. This Knowlege in- 
creafmg my Confidence, I talked to her of my 
Paffion, without being the leaft afraid of of- 
fending her. 

And therein you was greatly to blame, faid 
Arabella : For, truly, though the fair Dorothea 
told you, Ihe was Daughter to a Farmer ; yet, 
in all Probability, (he was of a much higher 
Extraftion, if the Figure you have drawn of 
her be true. 

The {2\x Affinoe^ Princefi of Armenia ^ was 
conftrained for a while to conceal her true 
Name and Quality, and pafs for a fimple 
Country-woman, under the Name of Delia : 
Yet the generous Philadelpb^ Prince of Ciliciay 
who faw and loved hereunder that Difguife, 
treated her with all the Refpeft he would have 
done, had he known fee was the Daughter of a 
Kmg. In Hke'manner, Prince Philoxipesi who 
fell in Love with the beautiful Policrete^ before 
he knew (he was the Daughter of the great 
Solon ; and while he looked upon her as a poor 
Stranger, born of mean Parents j nevcrthelefs, 
his Love fupplying the Want of thofe Advan- 
tages of Birth and Fortune, he wooed her with 
a raifion as full of Awe and Delicacy, as if her 
£xtr^£tion had been equal to his own. And 
therefore thofe admirable Qualities the fair 
Dorothea poflcfled, might alfo have convinced 
you^ {he was not what (he feemed, but, haply ^ 
fome great Prirtcefs in Difguife. 

To tell you the Truth, Madam, replied Sir 
George^ notwithftanding the fiair Dorothea in- 
formed me^ Ibe was of a mean Defcent, I could 

' not 



62 9^^ F E M A L E Book VL 

not cafily forego the Opinion, that flic was o( 
anilluftrious Birth : And the Biftories of thofe 
fair Princefles you have mentionied, coming in*- 
to my Mind, I alfb thought it very poflible^ 
that this divine Perfon might either be the 
Daughter of a great King, or Lawgiver, like 
them; but, being wholly engroffed by the Vio- 
lence of my new-born AfFeSion, I liftened to 
nothing, but what moft flattered my Hopes 5. 
and, addrefling my lovely Shepherdefs with all 
the Freedom of a Perfon who thinks his Birth 
much fuperior to hers ; flie liftened to my Pro- 
teftations„ without any feeming Reluftance,. 
and condefcended to afture me before we part- 
ed, that {ht did not hate me. So fair a Begin- 
ning, feemed to promife me the moft favour- 
able Fortune I could with Reafon expe£l. I 
parted fronvmy fair Shepherdefs with a thoufand 
Vows of Fidelity ; exafting a Promife from 
her, that flie would meet me as often as flie 
conveniently could, and have the Goodnefs to 
Kften to thofe AfTurances of inviolable Tender* 
nefs my Paffion prompted roe to offer her. 
When flie left me, it ieemed as ifmy Soul had 
forfaken my Body to go after her : My Eyes 
purfued her Steps as loi^ as flie was in Sight; I^ 
envied the Ground flie preft as flie went along, 
and the Breezes that kifled that celeftial 
Countenance in their Flight. 

For fome Hours I flood in the fame Pofture 
ki which flie had l^ft me ; contemplating the 
fijdden Change I had experienced in my Heart,, 
and the Beauty of that divine Image, which* 
was no'W engraven in it. Night drawing on, I

FO R fome Months, continued Sir Georgt^ 
1 profecutcd my Addreffes to the admir-

Hope, that 1 had made fome Progrefe in her

dure, at the time (he vowed eternal Conftancy 
to me, gave her Hand taa Lover of her Fa- 
ther's providing, and abandoned me, without 
Remorfe, to the moft cruel Defpair. 

I will not trouble you, Madam, with the 
Repetition of thofe Complaints, which this- 
perfidious Adion drew from me for a long time. 
At length, my Courage enabling me to over- 
come the Violence of my Grief, I refolved xo

the Sight of another Beauty completing my 
Cure, 1 no longer remembred the unfaithful 
Shepherdefs, but with Indifference. 

Thus, Madam, have I faitiifully i elated one 
of thofe Infidelities, wherewith my Enemies 
0ander me ; who can fupiport their AfTertion, 
with no better Proof, than that I did not die, 
when Dorothea abancjoned me : But I fubmit 
it to your Candour, whether an unfaithful 
Miflrefs defer ved fuch an Inftance of Affec- 
tion, from a Lover flic had betrayed ? 

Why, really, replied^r^W/^, after a little 
Paufe,^ you had fome Excufe to plead" for your 
t^'ailure in this Point : And though you cannot 
be called, the moft perfe£l amongft Lovers, 
feeing you neither died, nor was in Danger of 
dying; yet neither ought you to be ranked 
among thofe who are moft culpable : But pray 
proceed in your Story : I fliall be better able to 
form a right Judgment of your Merit as a Lo- 
ver, when 1 have heard all your Adventures. 

My Paflion for Dorothea^ refumed Sir George ^

my Sword alone had procured for him j^ but, 
having unwittingly engaged myfelf too far in 
Purfuit of the flying Enemy, I found myfelf 
alone, ehcompaffed with a Party of about Five 
hundred Men ; who, feeing they were piirfued 
only by a fmgle Man, faced about, and pre- 
pared to kill or take me Prifoner. 

Pray, Sir, interrupted Sir CA^r/^j, when did 
all this happen ? And how came it to pafs, that 
your Friends have been ignorant to this Mo- 
ment of thole Prodigies of Valo.ur you per- 
formed at that Battle ? I never heard you was 
ever in a fiattle : Fame has done you great In- 
juftlce, by concealing the Part you had 'in that 
famous Viilory. 

The great Care I took to conceal myfelf, 
replied Sir George^ was one Reafon why my 
Friends did not attribute to me the Exploits, 
which the Knight in black Armour, who was 
no other than myfelf, performed j and the Ac* 
<!dent I am going to relate, prevented my be- 
ing difcovered, while the Memory of thofe 
great Exploits were yet frefli in the Minds of 
thofe I had fo greatly obliged. 

Be pleafed to know, therefore. Madam, that, 
feeing myfelf about to be encompafled by this 
Party of the Enemy, I difdain^d to fly ; and, 
though I was alone, refolved to fufiain their 
Attack, and fell my Life as dear as poiEble. 

Why, if you did fo, you was a Madman, 
cried Sir Charles in a Heat : The braveft Man 
that ever lived, would not have prefumed to

fight with fo great a Number of Enemies* What 
could you expe<£l, but to be cut in Pieces ? 
Pooh ! pooh ! don't think any body will credit 
• fuch a ridiculous Tale : I never knew you was 
fo addicted to — 

Lying, perhaps, the good Knight would have 
faid J but Sir George^ who was concerned he 
was prefent at his Legend, and could not 
blame him for doubting his Veracity, prevent- 
ed his Utterance of a Word he would be oblig- 
ed to take ill, by abruptly going on with his 
Story. 

Placing my Back therefore s^ainft a Tree, 
purfued he, to prevent my being affaulted be- 
hind, I prefented my Shield to the Boldeft of 
thefe Affailantsj who, having ftruck an impo- 
tent Blow upon it, as he was lifting up his Arm 
to renew his Attack, I cut it off with one 
Stroke of my Sword ^ and the fame Inftant 
plunged it to the Hilt in the Breaft of another^ 
and clove the Scull of a Third, who was mak- 
ing at me, in two Parts. 

Sir Charlis^ at this Relation, burft into % 
loud Fit of Laughter ; and, being more inclined 
to divert himfelf, than be offended at the Folly 
and Vanity of the young Baronet, he permitted 
him to go on with his furprifing Story, with- 
out giving him any other Interruption. 

Thefe Three Executions, Madam, purfued 
Sir George^ were the Effefis only of fo many 
Blows; which raifed fuch Indignation in my 
Enemies, that they preft forward in great Num- 
bers to deftroy me ; but, having, as I before 
laid, pofted myfelf fo advantageoufly, that I 
could only be afliauked before, not more than

Three or Four could attack meat one time. The 
Deflre of lengthening out my Life, till Jiappily 
fome Succour might come to my Relief, fo in- 
vigorated my Arm, and added to my ordinary 
Strength an almoft irrefiftible Force, that I dealt 
Death at every Blovsr ; and in left than a quar- 
ter of an Hour, faw more than Fifty of my 
Enemies at my Feet, whofe Bodies ferved for a 
Bulwark againft their Fellows Swords. 

The Commander of this little Body, not 
having Generofity enough to be moved with 
thofe prodigious EfFefts of my Valour in my 
Favour, was tranfported with Rage at my Re- 
fiftance ; and the Sight of fo many of his Men 
flain before his Face, ferved only to increafe 
his Fury ; and that Moment, feeing, that, with 
Two more Blowsi, I had fent Two of his moft 
valiant Soldiers to the Shades, and that the reft 
fearing to come within the Length of my 
Sword, had given me a few Moments Rc- 
fpitc, 

Ah ! Cowards ! cried he, are you afraid of 
a fingle Man ? And will you fufFer bim to 
efcape from your Vengeance, who has flain fa 
many of your brave Comrades before your 
Eyes ? 

Thefe Words infpiring them with a Fierce- 
nefs, fuch as he defired, they advancefli towards 
me with more Fury than before : By this time> 
I had received feveral large Wounds, arid my 
Blood ran down from many Parts of my Body : 
Yet was I not fenfible of any Decay of Strength^ 
nor did the fettled Defigns of my Enemies to 
deftroy me daunt me in the leaft : Iftill relied 
upon the Affiftance I expelled Providence

would fend to my Relief, and deterihined, if 
poflible, to prefcrve my Life, till it arrived. 

I fought, therefore, with a Refolution, which 
tftoniihed my Enemies, but did not nioye them 
to ally Regard for my Safety : And, obferving 
their brutal Commander, a few Paces^ from me, 
encouraging his Men, both with his Cries and 
Gefiures, Indignation againfl this inhuman 
Wretch fo tranfported me out of my Difcre- 
tion, that I quitted my Poft, in order to facri- 
fice him to my Revenge. 

Seeing me advance furioufly towards him, he 
turned pale with Fear, and endeavoured to fhel- 
tcr himfelf in the midft of his Men; who, mor* 
Italian t than himielf, oppofed themfelves to my 
Rage, to favour his Retreat : But quickly clear- 
ing myfelf a Way with my Sword, I preffed to- 
wards the barbarous Coward ; and, ere he could 
avoid the Blow I aimed at him, it (truck him 
fenfelefs at my Feet. 

My particular Revenge thus fatisfied, I was 
fenfible of the Fault I had committed in quit- 
ting my Poft, by which I expofed inyfelf to be 
furrounded by the Enemy. I endeavoured to 
regain it, but in vainr I was befet on all Sides, 
and now defpaired of any Safety ; and there- 
fore only fought to diecourageoufly, and make 
as many of my Enemies as I could, attend 
my Fall. 

Exafperated by the Misfortune of their Com- 
mander, they preflcd upon me with redoubled 
Fury. Faint as I was, with the Lofs of Blood, 
and fo fatigued with the paft A£^ion, and the 
obftinate Fight I had maintained fo long with 
fuch a conflderable Number, I could hardly any

longer life up my Arm ; and, to complete, my 
Misfortune, having tbruft my Swprd into the 
Body of one of the forwarded of my Enemies, 
in my endeavouring to regain it, it broke in 
Pieces, and the Hilt only remained in my Hand. 

This Accident completed my Defeat:' De- 
prived of my Sword, I was no longer capable 
of making any Defence : Several of them prefTed 
upon me at once; and, throwing me down* 
tied my Hands together behind me. Shame, and 
Rage at this Indignity worked fo forcibly up- 
on my Spirts, weakened as I then was, that I 
fell into, a Swoon* What happened till my Re- 
covery, I am not able to tell ; but, at the Re- 
turn of my Senfes, I found myfelf laid on a 
Bed in a tolerable Chamber, and feme Perfons 
with me, who kept a profound Silence,

RECOLLECTING in a few Moments 
all that happened to me, I could not 
choofe but be furprifed at finding myfelf 
treated with fo little Severity, confidering I 
was .Prifoner to Perfons who had been Wit- 
hefTes of the great Quantity of Blood I had 
filed in my own Defence. My Wounds had 
been drefled while I continued in my Swoon;

70 -7^^ F EM A L E Book VI. 

After refle^ing fome time longer on my 
Situation, I called to a young Man, who fat 
near my Bed fide, and intreated him to inform 
me, Where I was, and to whom I was a Pri- 
foner ? But could get no other Anfwer to thofe 
Queftions, than a moft civil Intreaty to com- 
pofe myfelf, and not protra6l the Cure of my 
Wounds by talking, which, the Surgeons had 
declared, would be of a bad Confequencei 
and had therefore ordered me to be as little 
•difturbed as poflible. 

Notwithftanding this Remonftrance, I re- 
peated my Requeft, promifmg to be entirely 
governed by them for the future in what re- 
garded my Health, provided they would fatisfy . 
me in thofe Particulars : But my Attendant did 
not fo much as reply to thofe Importunities; 
but, to prevent the Continuance of them, rofe 
from his Seat, and retired to the other End of 
the Chamber. 

I pafled that Day, and feveral others, with- 
out being able to learn the Truth of my Condi- 
tion : All this time, I was diligently waited on 
by the two Perfons I had firft feen, neither 
of whom I could prevail upon to inform me 
of what I defired to know ; and, judging, by 
this obftinate Referve, and the Manner of my 
. Treatment, that there was fome Myftery in 
the Cafe, I forbore to a(k them any more 
Queftions, conceiving they had particular Or- 
ders not to anfwer them. 

The Care that was taken to forward my 
Cure, in Three Weeks entirely reftored mc 
to Health : I longed impatiently to know, 
what was to be my Deftiny ; and bufied myfelf 



Chap. 3- CLUIXOTE. yt 

in conjecturing it, in vain ; when, one Morning, 
an elderly Lady entered my Chamber, at whofe 
Appearance my Two Attendants retired. 

After (be had faluted me very civilly, and 
inquired after my. Health, (he feated herfelf in 
a Chair near my Bedfide, and fpoke to me in 
this manner : 

I make no queftion. Sir, but you are fur- 
prifed at the Manner in which you have beea 
created, and the Care there has been taken to 
prevent difcovering to you the Place where 
you now are ; but you will doubtlefi be more 
furprifed, tohearyou are in tbeFortreis of——, 
and in the Houfe of Prince Marcomin^ whofe 
Party you fought againft alone j and whom 
3rou fo dangeroufly wounded, before you was' 
taken Prifoner by his Men, 

Is it poflible. Madam, faid I, who, from 
the firft Moment of her Appearance, had been 
in a ftrange Perplexity, is it poilible, I am in . 
the Houfe of a Man, whofe Life I endeavoured 
fo eagerly to deftroy ? And is it to him, who 
oppreiTed me fo bafely with Numbers, that I 
am obliged for the Succour I have received ? 

It is not to him, replied the Lady, that you 
are obliged for the favourable Treatment you 
have had ; but liften to me patiently, and I 
will difclofe the Truth of your Adventure. 

Prince Marcomre^ who was the Perfon that 
headed that Party againft which you fo valiant. 
ly defended yourfelf, after the Lofs of the 
Battle, was haftening to throw himfelf into 
this Place, where bis Sifter, and many Ladies 
fii Quality, had come for Security : Your in- 

difcreec 



71 The FEMALE BookVI. 

difcreet Purfuit engaged you in the moft un* 
equal Combat that ever was fought ; and — 

Nay, Sir, interrupted >/rtf^//A?, though I do 
not refufe to give you all the Praifes your gal-* 
lant Defence of yourfelf againft Five hundred 
Men defcrves ; yet I cannot agree with that 
I^ady, in faying, it was the moft unequal Com- 
bat that ever was fought : For, do but refled, I 
befeech you, upon that .which the brave Prince 
oiMauritania fuftained againft twice that Num- 
ber of Men, .with no other Arms than his 
Sword ; and, you having been in Battle that 
Day, was, as I conceive, completely armed. 
The young Prince of Egypt ^ accompanied only 
by the valiant, but indifcreet, Cepio his Friend, 
engaged all the King of Armenians Guards, 
and put them all to Flight* The courageous 
jtriobafanis fcorned to turn bis Back upon a 
whole Army \ not to mention the invincible 
jfrtahart^ whom a thoufand Armies together 
could not have made to turn. 

Be pleafed to obferve, Madam , faid Sir George^ 
that to the end I may faithfully recount my 
Hiftory, I am under a Neccflity of repeating 
Things, which, haply, 'may feem too advan- 
tageous for a Man to fay of himfelf : Therefore 
I indeed greatly approve of the Cuftom, which, 
no doubt, this Inconveniency introduced, of a 
'Squire, who is thoroughly inftru£led with the 
Secrets of his Mafter's Heart, relating his Ad^ 
ventures, and giving a proper £ulogium of his 
rare Valour, without being in Danger of of- 
fending the Modefty of the renowned Knight ; 
who, as you know. Madam, upon tbofe Oc- 
cafions, commodioufly flips away. 



Chap. 3. QUIXOTE. 75 

It being, however, this Ladj's Opinion, that 
no Man ever undertook a more hazardous Com- 
bat, or with greater Odds, againft him, (he did 
not fail to exprefs her Admiration of it, in verjr 
high Terms. - 

The Noife of this Accident, purfued fhe, 
was fooQ fpread over the whole Town ; am) 
the beautiful Sydimiris^Marcomife^ sSi&cr^ hear- 
ing that her Brother was wounded, as it was 
thought to Death, and that the Perfon who 
Jcilled htm, was taken Prifoner ; fhe flew out 
to meet her wounded Brother, diftra&ed with 
Grief, and vowing to have the fevered Tor- 
tures executed on him, who had thus barba- 
roufly murdered her Brother. Thofewho bore 
that unhappy Prince, having brought him into 
the Houfe, his Wounds were fearched ^ and 
the Surgeons declared, they were very dan- 
gerous. 

Sydimiris^ hearing this, redoubled her Com- 
plaints and Vows of Vengeance againft you : 
Her Brother having then the chief Authority in 
the Place, (he commanded, in his Name, to 
have you brought hither, and to be moftftriSly 
guarded ; determined, if her Brother died, to 
facrifice you to his Ghoft. 

FuJl of thefe fanguinary Refolutions, flie 
left his Chamber, having feen him laid in Bed ; 
-and his Wounds drefTed ; but pafling along a 
Gallery to her own Apartment, (he met the 
Perfons who were bringing you to the Room 
that was to be your Prifon : You was not, pur- 
fued theLady, yet recovered from yourSwoon, 
fo that they carried you like one that was dead : 
They had taken ofF your Helmet to give you

Air ; by which means your Face being quite 
uncovered, pale, languifliing, and your Eyts 
clofed, as if in Death, prefented the moft 
moving, and, at the fame time, moft pleaiiog 
.Objea in the World. 

SydimiriSy who ftopt, and for a Moment 
eagerly gazed upon you, loft all of a fudden 
the Fiercenefs, which before had animated her 
againft you : And lifting up her Eyes to view 
thofe Men that carried you ; 

Are you fure, faid fhe to them, that this is 
the Perfon who wounded my Brother ? 

Yes, Madam, replied one of them; this muft 
be he, fince there was no other in his Com- 
pany ; and he alone fuftained the Attack of Five 
hundred Men ; and would probably not have 
left one of them alive, had not his Sword, by 
breaking, put it into our Power to take him 
Prifoner. 

. Carry him away, faid Sydimirh; but let his 
Wounds be dreffed, and let him be carefully 
looked to, that, if my Brother dies, he may 
bc4;)unifhed as he deferves. 

Pronouncing thefc Words in a low and fal- 
tering Voice, flie turned her Eyes a fecond time 
upon you ; then, haftily averting her Looks, 
£he hurried to her own Chamber, and threw 
herfclf into a Chair, with all the Marks of a 
very great Difturbance. 

The AfFeftion I have for her, being the Per- 
fon who had brought her up, and moft favoured 
with her Confidence, made me behold her in 
this Condition with great Concern ; and fup- 
pofing it was her Brother that difquieted her, 
I befought her not to give way to the Violence 

of 



Chap. J. QUIXOTE. 7y 

of her Grief, but to hope that Heaven would 
rcftore him to her Prayers. 

Alas! my iezrUrinoey faid (he, I am more 
culpable than you can imagine ; and I grieve lefs 
for the Condition to which I fee Marcomire re- 
duced, than for that Moderation wherewith I 
am conftrained, fpite of myfelf, to behold hfs 
Enemy. 

Yes, dear Urineej purfued flie^ blufhing^ 
and cafting down her Eyes^ the Aftions of 
this Unknown appear to me in quite another 
Light, flnce I have feen him ; and, inftead of 
looking upon him as the Murderer of my Bro- 
ther, I cannot help admiring that rare Valour^ 
with which he defended himfelf ag^inft fo great 
a Number of Enemies ; and am even ready to 
condemn the furious Marcomire^ for oppreffing 
fo brave a Man. 

As I had never approved of thofe violent 
Tranfports of Grief and Rage, which flie had 
cxpreffed upon the firft News of her Btother^s 
Misfortune ; and as I looked upon your glo- 
rious Defence with the utmoft Admiration ; fo^ 
far from condemning the Change of her 
Thoughts, I confirmed her in the favourable 
Opinion fhe began to entertain of you ; and, 
continuing to make Remarks upon all the Par* 
ticulars of the Combat, which had come to 
our Knowlege, we found nothing in your Bc^ 
haviour, but what increafed our Admiratidn. 

Sydimiris therefore, following the Didates 
of her own Generofity, as well as my Advice^ 
|)laccd Two Perfons about you, whofe Fide* 
•iity we could rely on ; and gave them Order^ 
•to treat you with all imaginable Care and Re*

fpeA, but not to inform you of the Place in 
which you was, or to whom you wis Pri- 
Ibner. 

In the mean time, Marcomire^ whofe 
Wounds had been again examined, was de-» 
clared out of Danger by the Surgeons \ and he 
having underftood the Excefs of his Sifter's 
Grief, and the Revenge (he had vowed agairtft 
you, gave her 7'hanks for thofe Expreflions of 
her Tenderncfs ; and alfo uttered fome Threats, 
which intimated a violent Hatred againft you; 
and a Defign of profecuting his Revenge upon 
you, as foon as he was in a Condition to leave 
bis Chamber. 

Sydimiris, who heard him, could with Dif- 
ficulty difleroble her Concern. 

Ah ! Urirjoe, faid (he to me, when we were 
alone ; 'tis now, that I more than ever repent 
of that Excefs of Rage, which tranfported me 
againft the brave Unknown. I have thereby 
put him intirely into my Brother's Power, and 
fliall be haply acceflary to that Death he is 
meditating for him, or elfe a perpetual Impfi- 
fonment. 

This Reflexion gave her fo much Pain, that 
I could not choofe but pity her ; and confider- 
ing, that the only way to preferve you, was 
for her to diffemble a Rage equal to Mar* 
£omire\ againft you, in order to prevent being 
fufj^^efted qf any Defign in your Favour, I per- 
fuaded her to join with him in every thing he 
faid ; while, in the mean time, we would en- 
deavour to get you cured of your Wounds, that 
you might at leaft be in a Condition once more 

to

to defend yourfelf with that miraculous Valour 
Heaven has beftowed on yoJT. 

Sydimiris perceiving her Brother would Toon 
be in a Condition to execute his Threats, refolv- 
cd to hazard every thing, rather than to expofe 
you to his K.3ge : She therefore communicated 
to me her Deiign of giving you Liberty, and, 
by prefenting a fufficient Reward to your 
Guard, inducing them to favour your Efcapc. 

I undertook to manage this Bufmefs in her 
Name, and have done it fo efFed^ually, that 
you will this Night be at Liberty, and may 
depart the Town immediately, in which it will 
be dangerous to ftay 4ny time, for fear of 
being difcovered. 

Sydimiris forbad me to let you know tha 
Perfon to whom you would be obliged for your 
Freedom ; but I could not endure, that you 
Ihould unjuftly involve the Sifter of Marcomirt^ 
in that Refentment you will queftionlefs always 
prefer ve againft him ; and to keep you from being 
innocently guilty of Ingratitude, I refolved to 
acquaint you with the Nature of thofe Obliga- 
tions you owe to her.

which I ihail depart with inconceivable Sorrow. 

Depend upon it, valiant Sir, replied (he, 
that if what you will require of me, be in my 
Vower, and fit for me to grant, I fhall very. 
Willingly oblige you. 

It is then, refumed I, trembling at the Bold- 
ncfs of my Rcqueft, that you would conde- 
fccnd to intreat the moft generous Sydimins to 
favovjr me with an Interview, and give me an 
Opportunity of throwing myfelf at her Feet, 
to thank her for all thofe favours I have re- 
'■ ceived from her Compaffioa. 

I cannot promife you, replied the Lady» 
fifing, to prevail upon Sydimiris to grant you an 
Audience ; but I afTure you, that I will endea- 
vour to dtfpofe her to do you this Favour; and 
it' Oiall not be my Fault, if you are not (k-

Saying this, flie went out of my Chamber, 
I having followed her to the Door, with Pro- 
teftations that I would never forget her Kindnefs 
upon this Occafion. 

I paft the reft of that Day in an anxious Im- 

E ice for Night, divided between Fear and

Sure, Sir, replied Arabella^ you do not ima- 
gine, that Sir George would have failed in 
executing all he had promifed to the beautiful

(he have expeSed from a Man, whom at the 
Hazard of her own Life and Happinefs, (he had

I accompanied thefe Words, Madam, pur-

Accent, that the fair Sydimiris blufhcd, and, 
for a Moment, caft down her Eyes with a 
vifible Confufion. At laft, 

Sir, replied (he, I am too well fatisfied with 
what I have done, with refpex^ to your Safety, 
-to require any Proofs of your Gratitude, that 
might be dangerous to it ; and (hall remain ex- 
tremely well fatisfied, if the Obligations you- 
think you owe me, may induce you to mode- 
rate your Refentment againft my Brother, for 
the cruel Treatment -you received from him*. . 

Doubt not, Madam, interrupted I; eagerly, 
but I (hall, in the Perfon of Marcomire^ regard 
.the Brother of the divine Sydimiris y and that 
Confideration will be fufftcient, not only to 
make me forget all the Violences he committed 
againft me, but even to- defend his Life, if need 
be, with the Hazard of my owrh. 

Exceffively generous indeed! faid Sir 67A!jr/^*:-

A Third, having contrafted a violent Friend-

is in Perfon. 

I muft confefs, faid Sir Charles^ that Gene- 
rofity feems to me very peculiar, that will make 
a Man fight for his Enemies againft his own 
Father. 

It is in that Peculiarity, Sir, faid Arabella^ 
that his Generofity confilts ; for certainly there 
is nothing extraordinary in fighting for one's 
Father, and ohe's Country ; but when a Man 
has arrived to fuch a Pitch of Greatnefs of

George'^ Merit, I mull ftill infift, that in the 
Kefolutions he had taken to defend his £oe* 
jny's Life at the Expence of his own, he did 
no.more^ than what any Man of ordinary Ge- 
jierofity ought to do, and what he was partlcu* 
larly obliged to, by what the amiable Sydimiris 
had done for him. 

Iwa^ fo happy, however. Madam, continued 
Sir George^ to find that thofe Expreffions of my 
Gratitude wrought fomewhat upon the Heart 
of the lovely Sydimiris in my Favour : Her 
Words difcovered as much, and her Eyes fpoke 
yet more intelligibly; but our Converfation was 
interrupted by the difcreet TJrinae^ who, fearing 
the Confequence of fo long a Stay in her Cham- 
ber, reprefented to me, that it was time to 
take my Leave. 

I turned pale at this cruel Sound ; and, be- 
holding Sydimiris with a languifhing Look, 

Would to Heaven,,. Madam, faid I, that 
inftead of giving me Liberty, you would keep • 
me eternally your Prifoner ; for though a Dun- 
geon was to be the Place of my Confinement, 
yet if it was near you, it would feem a Palace 
to me ; for indeed I am no longer in a Condi- 
tion to relifti that Freedom you beftow upon 
me, fince it 'muft remove me farther from you ; 
But I befeech yon. Madam, to believe, that in 
delivering me from your Brother's Festers, you 
have caft me into your own, and that I am more 
a Prifoner than ever, but a Prifoner to fo lovely 
a Conqueror, that I do not wifh to break my* 
Chains, and prefer the fweet and glorious Cap-

You arc very bold, hid Sydimirisy blufliing, 
to entertain me with Aich Difcourfe ; yet I 
pardon this Offence, in Confideration of what 
you have fuffered from my Brother, and on 
Condition that you will depart iounediately, 
without fpeaking another Word. 

Sydimiris fpoke this fo earneftly, that I durft 
not difobey her ; and, kiffing the Hem of her 
Robe, with a paffionate Air, I left ber Cham* 
ber, condu£ked by Vrinoe ; who having brought 
me to a private Door, which carried us into 
the Street, I there found a Man waiting for 
me, whom I knew to be the fame that had 
attended me during my Stay in that Houfe. 

Urinoe having recommended to him to fee 
me fafe out of the Town, I took Leave of 
her, with the moft grateful Acknowlegements 
for her Kindnefs ; and followed my Conductor, 
fo opprefled with Grief at the Thoughts of 
leaving the Place where Sydimiris was, that I 
had hardly Strength to walk*

the Divine Sydimiris^ I all at once took a Re« 
folution to remain in the Town concealed ; arid, 
communicating my Defign to my Guide, 1 cpf- 
gaged him to affift me in it, by a Prefent of a 
confideraWe Sum, which he could not refill : 
Accordingly he left me in a remote Rrt of tl^e 
Town, and went to find out a convenient Lodg. 
ing for me; which he fbon procured, and atio 
a Suit of Cloaths to difguife me, my own being, 
very rich and magnificent. 

Having recommended nre as a Relation of 
his, who was newly arrived, I was received 
very civilly by the People with whom he placeif 
me ; and, finding this young Man to be very 
witty and difcreet, and alfo very capable of 
ferving me, I communicated to him my In« 
tentions by ftaying, which were only to be near 
the Divine Sydimiris^ and to have the Happinefs 
of fometimes feeing her, when fhe wenc 
abroad » 

This Man entering into my Meaning, aflurecf 
me, he would faithfully keep my Secret 5 and 
that he would not fail to bring me Intelligence 
of all that paffed in the Palace of Marcomire, 

I could with Difficulty keep myfelf front 
falling at his Feet, to exprefs my Senfe of his- 
kind and generous Offers ; but I contented 
myfelf with prefenting him another Sum of 
Money, larger than the firft, and aflured hina- 
of my future Gratitude. 

He then took Leave, and left me to my Re- 
flexions, which were wholly upon the Image 
of the Divine Sydimiris^ and the Happinefs of 
bei0g fo near the Obje<3; I adored. 

My 



U The FEMALE BookVI. 

My Confident came to me the i^^t Day ; 
but brought me no other News, than that my 
Efcape was not yet known to Marc&mire. I 
inquired if he had feen Sydlmins 5 but he re- 
plied he had not, and that Urinoi had only 
aiked him, if he bad condu£l^d me fafe out of 
Town : To which he had anfwered as we had 
agreed, that I had got out fafe and undifco- 
Vered. 

A Day or two after, he brought me News 
more pleafing j for he told me, that Sydimiris 
had fent for him into her Chamber, and afked 
him feveral Queftions concerning me: .That 
&e appeared very melancholy, and even bluCb- 
fd, whenever fiie mentioned my Name. 

This Account gave fufficient Matter for my 
Thoughts to work upon for feveral Days. I 
interpreted Sydimiris* s Blufh a Thoufand differ- 
ent Ways ; I reflefled upon all the different 
Caufes to which it might be owing, and bufied 
myfelf with all thofe innunierable Conjeftures, 
which, as you know, Madam, fuch an Incident 
always gives Rife to in a Lover's Imagination. 
At length I explained it to my own Adv^^ntage^ 
and felt thereby a confiderable Increafe of my 
AfFedkion. 

A whole Week having elapfed, without 
another Sight of my Confidant, I began to be 
greatly alarmed. 5 when, on the Eighth Day of 
this cruel Sufpenfe, I faw him appear ; but with* 
fo many Marks of Diflurbance in his Face, 
that I trembled to hear what he had to acquaint 
me with. 

Oh ! Sir, faid he, as foon as his Concern 
fufi^ered him to fpeak^ Marcomire has difcovered 

your 



Ghap. f. QJJIXOTE. 87 

your Efcape, and the Means by which it was pro- 
cured : One of thofe in whom Urinoe confidedf 
has betrayed it to him i and the beauteous Sy* 
dimiris is likely to feel the moft terrible EfFefts 
of his Difpleafure : He has confined her to her 
Chamber, and vows to facrifice her Life to the 
Honour of his Family ; which he fays, fhe 
lias ftained ; and lie loads that admirable Lady 
with fo many Reproaches, that it is thought, 
her Grief for fuch undeferved Calumnies wilt 
occafion her Death, 

Scarce had he finiflied thefe cruel Words, 
when I, who all the time he had been fpeaking, 
beheld him with a dying Eye, funk down at 
his Feet in a Swoon; which continued folong, 
that he began to think me quite dead : How- 
ever I at laft opened my Eyes; but it was only 
to pour forth a River of Tears, and to utter 
Complaints, which might have moved the moft 
obdurate Heart. 

After having a long time tormented myfelf 
in weeping and complaining, I at laft took a 
Refolution, which afforded me fome Alleviation 
of my Grief; and the faithful Ti^-^yr^^, feeing 
me a little compofed, left me to myfelf, with 
a Promife to return fooh, and acquaint me with 
what paffed further in the Palace of Marcomire. 

As foon as he was gone, I rofe from my Bed 5 
and, dreffing myfelf in thofe Cloaths I wore 
when I was taken Prifoner," I went to the Pa- 
lace oi Marcomire ; and, demanding to fee him, 
I was told he was in the Apartment of Sydimi^ 
ris ; and, at my earncft Defire, they conduced 
Aie thither. 

When

. When I entered tl^e Room, I beheld that 
incomparable Beauty ffretched upon a Couch, 
diffolved in Tears ; and Urinoe upon hcr.Kneea, 
before her, accompanying with her own, thofe 
jpreciou6 Drops which fell from the bright Eyes 
of her Miftrefs. 

Marcomire^ who was walking furioufly about 
the Room, exclaiming with the utmoft Vio- 
lence againft that fair Sufferer, did not obferve 
my Entrance ; fo that I had an Opportunity of 
going towards SydimirtSy who, lifting up her 
Eyes to look upon me, gave a loud Shriek ; 
and, by a Look of extreme Anguifb, let me 
underfland, how great her Apprehenfions were 
upon my Account. 

I am come. Madam, faid I, to perform 
Part of the Promife I made you, and by dying, 
to prove your Innocence; and, freeing you from 
the Reproaches you fuflFer on my Account, I 
ihall have the Happinefs to convince you, that 
my Life is infinitely lefs dear to me, than your 
Tranquillity, Sydimirisy who hearkened to 
me with great Emotion, was going to make 
fbme Anfwer, when Marcomire^ alarmed by 
his Sifter's Shriek, came towards us, and, view- 
ing me at firft with Aftonifliment, and then 
with a Smile of Cruelty and Revenge, 

Is it poflible, faid he, that I behold my de* 
figned Murderer again in my Power ? 

I am in thy Power, faid I, becaufe I am 
willing to be fo ; and came voluntarily to put 
myfelf into your Hands, to free that excellent 
Lady from the Imputation you have laid on her ;. 
Know, Marcomire^ that it is to myfelf alone 
I owed my Liberty, which I would ftill pre- 



Chap. 5. QUIXOTE. 5^ 

ferve againll all the Forces thou couldft bring to 
deprive me of it j and this Sword, whith left 
thee Life enough to threaten mine, would haply 
once more put yours in Danger, were I not re- 
ft rained by a powerful Confideration, which 
kaves me not the Liberty of even wifliing you 
ill. 

Ah r Diflembler, faid Marcomtre^ in a Rage, 
think not to impofe upon me by thy counter- 
feited Mildnefs : Thou art my Prifoner once 
more, and I (hall take care to prevent your 
efcaplng a Second time. 

I am not your Prifoner, replied I, while I 
poffefs ihis Sword, which has already defended 
me againft greater Numbers than you have here 
to oppofe me; but, continued I, throwing down 
fn^j Sword at SydiminYs Feet, I refign my Li- 
berty to reftore that Lady ta your good Opi- 
nion, and to free her from thofe bafe Afperftons 

" thou haft unjuftly loaded her with^ upon my 
Account. 

It matters not, (aid the brutal Brother, taking 
tip my Sword, whether thou haft refigiied, or 
I have deprived thee of Liberty ; but fince thou 
art in my Power, thou ftiall feel all the EfFedis 
of my Refentment : Take him away, purfued 
he to fome of his People ; put him into the worft 

' Dungeon you can find ; and let him be guarded 
carefully,, upon Pain of Death, if he again 
cfcapes. 

With thefe Words, feveral Men offered to 
lead me out of the Room ; but I repulfed them 
with Difdain ; and, making a low Reverence to

was allowed me, I read the following Wordsw

I refigned myfelf up to the moft delightful Ex-

-thofe fweet Thoughts, which her Letter had 
made me entertain. 

At length, on the Evening of a Day which

tranfportcd at the Sight of thefc Two Friexidfy 
and not doubting but they had brought me the 
moft agreeable News, I ran towards them ; and» 
throwing myfelf atl/r/wtf^'s Feet, I begged her, 
in an Ecftacy of Joy, to acquaint me with Sy^ 
dimirts*s Commands* 

Urinoey in fome Confufion at this Afiion, 
intreated me to rife. 'Tis fit, cried I, in a.. 
Tr^nfport I could not mafler, that in thb 
Pofture I (hould receive the Knowlege of that 
Felicity Sydimiris has had the Goodnefs to 
promife me. Urinoe fighed at thefe Words | 
and, beholding me with a Look of Compaifioa 
and Tendernefs, , • 

Would to God, faid (he, that all I have tO 
fay, were as agreeable, as the firfl News I have 
to tell you ; which is, that you are free, and at 
Liberty to leave the Town this Moment ! 5j|f- 
dimiris^ continued (he, has bought your Free- 
dom, at the Expence of her own ; and, to de- 
liver you from her Brother's Chains, fhe has 
put on others, haply more cruel than thofe 
you have worn : In fine, (he has married a Man, 
whom fhe iletefled, to procure your Liberty ; 
her Brother having granted it to her upon that 
Condition alone. 

Scarce had Urinoe finifhed thefe Words, when 
I fell, without Senfe or Motion, at her Feet, 
Toxares and (he, who had forefeen what might 
happen, having provided themfelves with Cor^ 
dials neceflary to reflore me, brought me to 
myfeif with infinite Trouble. 

Cruel t 



Ghap.^. QUIXOTE. 93 

Cruel ! faid I to them, with a Tone and 
Lbok, which witnefled the Excefs of my 
Defpair^ Why have you hindered me from 
dying, at once to prevent the thoufand Deaths 
I fliall fuffer from my Grief? Is this the Con- 
firmation of thofe glorious Hopes Sydimiris had 
permitted me to entertain ? Is this that Proof 
of the Acknowlegements I was to expect ? And 
18 It by throwing herfelf into the Arms of my 
Rival, that flie repays thofe Obligations fhe 
thinks (he owes me ? 

Ah ! inhuman Sydimiris I was it to make 
my Defpair more poignant, that thou flattereft 
me with fuch a Profpeft of Happinefs ? And 
was it neceflary, to the Grandeur of thy Nup- 
.tials, that my Life fhould be the Sacrifice ? 

But, how unjuft am I, cried I, repenting in 
an Inftant of thofe injurious Sufpicions ; How 
unjuft am I, to accufe the Divine Sydimiris of 
Inhumaiiity ? Was it not to give me Freedom, 
that flie beftowed herfelf upon a Man (he 
hates ? And has (he not made herfelf miferablc 
for ever, to procure me a fanfied Happinefs ? 

Ah ! if it be fo, what a Wretch am I ? I, 
who have been the only Caufe of that Mifery, 
to which (he has doomed herfelf ? Ah ! Liberty ! 
purfued I, how I deteft thee, fince purchased 
by the Misfortune of Sydimiris ! And how far 
more fweet and glorious were thofe Chains, 
which I wore for her fake ! 

My Sighs and Tears leaving me no longer 
the Power of Speech, I funk down on my Bed, 
opprefsM with a mortal Grief. 

Urinoc and Toxares drew n^ar to comfort me, 

and 



94- ^^e FEMALE BookV. 

and faid all Cbat fenfible and difcreet Perfons 
<ould think of to alleviate my Defpair. 

Though I have heard that Sydimiris is mar- 
ried, replied I, without dying immediately; 
yet do not imagine, that I will Tuffer this odious 
Life to continue long. If Sorrow do not quickly 
difpatch me, I will feek Death by other Means ; 
for fincc Sydimiris is loft, I have no more Bufi- 
nefs in the World. 

The charitable Urinoe and Toxares endea- 
voured in vain to divert me from this fad Re- 
folution, when Urinoe^ finding all their Reafon- 
ings incffeftual, drew a Letter out of her Pocket, 
and, prcfenting it to me, I had Orders, faid 
fhe, not to let this Letter be delivered to you, 
till you had left the Town ; but the Defpair, 
to which I fee you reduced, does, I conceive, 
difpenfe with my rigorous Obfervation of thofe 
Directions. 

While Urinoe was fpeaking, I opened this 
Letter trembling, and found it as follows.

there is no Man in the World I would have

the Remembrancex of your Affeftion, of which 

fou gave me fo generous an Inflance ; and the

complain, fince I could not be juft to you, 
without being cruel at the fame time, or con- 
*fer a Benefit, without loading you with a Mif- 
fortune. If the Sacrifice I have made of myfelf 
ibr your fake, gives me any Claim to the Con- 
tinuance of your Love, I command you, by 
ithc Power it gives me over you, to live, and 
not add to the Miferies of my Condition, the 
'Grief of being theCaufe of your Death. Re-

as an A£t of the moft cruel Ingratitude ; and 
your Compliance with this Requeft (hall ever

of that Paflion you have borne to the unfor*

Sydimiris, 

Ah ! Sydimiris^ cried I, having read this 
Letter, more cruel in your Kindnefs than Se- 
verity ! After having deprived me of yourfelf, 
do you forbid me to die ; and expofe me by fo

i)ard and painful than Death ?

TJrinoe and Toxares^ fomewhat reaffured, by 
the Refoltttion I had taken, exhorted me by all 
the Perfuafions, Friendfliip could put in their 
Mouths, to perfeverc in it y and, Urinoe bid- 
ding mc Farewel, I endtavoured to prevail upon 
her to procure me a Sight of Sydimiris once 
more, or at leaft to bear a Letter from me to 
her ; but fhe refufed both thefc Requefls fo 
obftinateJy, telling me, Sydimiris would neither 
confent to the one nor the other, that I was oblig- 
ed to be contented with the Promife fhe made 
me, to reprefent my Affli£lion in a true Light 
to her Miftrefs ; and to aflure her, that nothing 
but her abfolute Commands could have hin-

mc with much Tendernefs, fhe went out of 
the Prifon, leaving Toxares with me, who af- 
fifled me to drefs, and conducted me out of 
that miferable Place, where I had pafled fo many

he brought mc, I found a Horfe waiting ; and, 
having embraced this faithful Confidant, with 
many Expreffions of Gratitude, I beAowed a 
Ring of fome Value upon him to remember mc 
by; and, mounting my Horfe, with a breaking 
Heart, I took the firft Road which prefented 
itfelf to my Eyes, and galloped away, without 
knowing whither I went. I rode the whole

Chap. 7. QJJIXOTE. 97 

Night, fo totally engroffed by my Defpair, that 
I did not perceive my Horfe was fo tired, it 
could hardly carry me a Step farther : At laft 
the poor Bead fell down under me, fo that I 
was. obliged todifmount; and, looking about 
me, perceived I wai in a Foreft, without fee- 
ing the leaft Appearance of any Habitation. 

The Wildernefs, and Solitude of the Place, 
flattered my Defpair, and while my Horfe was 
feeding upon what Grafs he could find, I wan- 
dered about: The Morning jull breaking, gave 
me Light enough to direct my Steps. Chance 
at laft <x}ndu£ied me to a Cave, wliich feeitied 
fo have been the. Refidence of fome Hermit, or 
unfortunate Lover like myfelf. It was dug at 
the Side of a Rock, the Entrance to it thick 
fet with Bufhes, which hid it from View. Z 
defcended by a few Steps cut rudely enough, 
and was convinced, it had formerly ferved for

iraifed on each Side of it, a kind of Bed com* 
pofed of dried Leaves and Rufhes, and a Hole 
made artificially at the Top, to admit the Light. 

While I confidcred this Place attentively, 
I all at once took up a Refolution, infpired by 
my Defpair; which was, to continue there, 
and indulge my Mehncholy in a Retirement 
fo fitted for my Purpofe. 

Giving my Horfe therefore Liberty to go 
where he pleafed, and hanging up my Arms 
upon a Tree near my Cave, I took Pofleffion 
of dbis folitary Manfion, with a gloomy Kind 
of Satisfa£lion, and devoted all my Hours to 
the Contemplation of my MisfoftMJMa •

Complaints feemed to come, refolving to affift 
^ that unknown Perfon, with all the Strength 
chat was left me. 

Having gone fbrae Paces, I fpied through 
the Branches of the Trees a Man on HoHe- 
back with a Lady, who ftruggled to get loofe, 
and at times calling aloud for Succour. 

This Sight inflaming me with Rage againft 
that impious Ravi(her ; I flew towards him ; 
And when I came within hearing -, 

Hold, Wretch ! cried I, and ceafc to offer 
Violence to that Lady, whom thou beareft 
away by Force ; or prepare to defend th;^felf 
againft one, who will die, before he will fufier 
thee to profecute thy unjuft Defigns. 

The. Man, without anfwering me, clapped 
Spurs to Jiis Horfe ; and it would have been 
impoflible to have overtaken him, had not my 
own Horfe, which had never quitted the Forcft, 
appeared in my View : I quickly mounted him, 
and followed the Track the Ravifher had taken, 
with fuch Speed, that I came up with him in a 
Moment. 

Caitiff] faid I, releafe the Lady, and de- 
fend thyfelf. Thefe Words, which I accom— 
*panied with a thundering Blow upon his 
Head- piece, obliged him to fet down the L^dy^ 
who implored Heaven, with the utmoft Ar- 
dour, to grant me the ViSory : And, recoiling 
back a few Paces, to take a View of me, 

' I know not, faid he, for whatReafon thou 
fettett thyfelf to oppofe my Defigns ; but I

that, had I not received it on my Shield, I 
might haply have no longer been in a Condi- 
tiop to defend the diftrefled Lady : But, hav- 
ing, with the greateft Dexterity imaginable, 
avoided this Blow, I made at him with fo 
' much Fiercenefi, and directed my Aims fo 
well, that in a few Moments I wounded him 
in fcveral Places ; and his Arms were all dyed 
with his Blood. 

♦ This good Succefs redoubled my Vigour ; 
and having, by a lucky Stroke with my Sword, 
cut the Strings of his Head-piece, it fell off: 
And his Head being bare, I was going to let 
fall a dreadful Blow upon it, which dopbtlefs 
wpuld have Oiivered it in a thoufand Pieces, 
when he cried out for Quarter, and, letting fall 
his Sword, by that A£lion afliired me my Vi-

CompafSon at this Sight, I alighted, and, fu[v-

^Nature to work Wonders. 

' In fine, her Beauty was miraculous, and 
could not fail of producing a fudden EiFe^ 
upon a Heart like mine. 

Having pafTed in an Inftant from the ex* 
tremeft Admiration, to fomething yet more 
tender, I reiterated my Offers of Service to 
the fair Unknown ; who told me, fhe feared her 
Father had Occafion for fome Affiftance, her 
Ravilher having left his Men to engage him, and 
keep off his Purfuit, while he rode off with 
his jPrize : Hereupon I be^'d her tadiredl me 
to the Place where (he-left her Father, affurii^ 
her I would gladly venture my Life a Second 
jtime, to pre&rve his ; and fhe deflring to g9 
with me^ I placed her before me on my Horfe, 
and had the exquifite Pleafure of fupporting

mared to me biit a Moment^ we- got to the 
:rlace where ihe had been torn' frpmJier Father ; 
whom we beheld with three of his Servants, 
maintaining a Fight againft twice as many of 
their Enemies. 

Having gently fet down the beauteous Un- 
known upon the Grafs, I flew to the Relief 
of her Father ; and, throwing my felf furioufly 
amongft his Affailants, difpatcbed two of them 
with fo many Blows : The others, feeing fo un- 
expefted an Affiftance^ gave back a little ; and 

I took

I took Advantage of their Coafternation^ to 
redouble my Blows, and brougbt Two more 
of them at my Feet. 

There remained now but Four to overcome i 
and my Arrival having given new Vigour to 
thofe whofe Part I had taken, they feconded 
me fo well, that we foon had nothing more left 
to do ; for the reft, feeing their Comrades flain, 
fought their Safety in Flight : We were too 
generous to purfue them, the Blood of, fuch. 
Wretches being unworthy to be (bed by our 
Swords. 

The fair Unknown, feeing us Conquerors, 
flew to embrace her Father ; who, holding her 
prelTed between his Arms, turned his Eyes upon 
me ; then quitting her, came towards me, and, 
in the moft obliging Terms imaginable, re- 
turned me Thanks for the AfHftahce I h^ 
brought him ; and being informed by his 
Daughter, of what I had done for her Prefer*- 
vation, this old Gentleman renewed his Ac- 
knowlegements, calling me the Preferver of 
his Life, the valiant Defender of his Daugh- 
ter's Honour, his tutelary Angel, and ti^ 
Guardian of his Houfe* 

In fine, ho loaded me with fo many Thanks 
and Praifes, that I could not choofe but be in 
fome Confufion; and, to put an End to them, I 
begged he would inform me, by what mean» 
he came into that Misfortune. 

He told me, that, refiding in a CaftI.e at the 
Extremity of this Foreft, the Charms of his 
Daughter had captivated a neighbouring Lord, 
whole Character and Perfon being difa^re^ablc

fufed to give her to him : Thereupon he,had fet 
upon them as. they were going to vifit a Rela* 
tion at fome Diftance, and, dragging Pbtlonice 
out of the Coach, put her before him on his 
Horfe,> and carried her away, leaving £ight of 
bis Men to engage him, and his Servants ; who^ 
being but Four in Number, mull ineviubly 
<bave perifhed, had I not come to his Relief, 
and, by my miracubus Valour, vanquifhed all 
his Enemies. 

Saying this, he dedred me to go home with 
him to the Caftle ; and having led hi$ Daugh- 
ter to the Coach, infilled upon my placing my- 
felf next her ; and, getting in himifelf, ordered 
them to return home.

would ftay in the Room till my Armour was

At thecameftlncreatyof ^hefiaron, lilaid 
Ibme Weeks-in the Caftle ; during which, the 
daily Sight of Pbilonke io augmented my 
flames, that I was no longer ina Condition to 
conceal them ; but, Tearing to d^pleafe that Di- 
vine JBeauty by a.Confeffion of my Paifion, I 
languifbed in fecret ; and the Conftraint I laid 
upon myfelf, gave me fuch Torments, that I 
fellinto a profound Melancholy, and looked 
fo pale and dejedled, that the Baron .was fend- 
ble of the Alteration, and oonjured me in the 
moft preying TermSj to acquaint; him with the 
Cauie of my Uneafmefs : But though I conti- 
nued obftinately filent with my Tongue, yet 
my £yes fpoke intelligibly enough ; and the 
Blufhes which appeared in the fair Cheeks 
of Philonice^ whenever (he fpoke to me on the 
SubjeA of my Qrief, convinced me ihe was 
not ignorant of my Eaffioni . 

At length the Agitation of my Mind throw-

per fuaded, that my lilnefs proceeded from fome 
concealed^ Vexation, preffcd me continually to 
declare myfelf; and, finding all his Intreaties 
ineffe£lual) he commanded his Daughter toen^ 
deavour to fmd out the Caufe of that Grief 
which had put me into fach a Condition. 

For that Purpofe. therefore, having brought

And why, replied fhe, with a Tone fiiU of

For, in fine. Sir, purfued (he, you will ne- 
ver perfuade any reafonable Perfon, that your 
being able to lofe the Remembrance of the fair 
and generous SydimriSy in your new Paffion for 
Philonice^ was not an Excct of Levity : But 
your fuffering fo tamely the Lofs of this laft 
Beauty, and allowing her to remain in the 
Hands of her Ravifher, while you permit an- 
other AfieAion to take Pofleflion of your Soul, 
IS fuch an Outrage to all Truth and Conftancy, 
diat you deferve to be ranked among the falfeft 
of Mankind. 

Alas ! Madam, replied Sir George ^ who had 
not forefeen the Influence Arabella would draw 
from this laft Adventure, What would you 
have an unfortunate Man, whofe Hopes have 
beenfo often, and fo cruelly, difappointed, do} 
I have bewailed the Lofs of Philmice^ with a 
Deluge of Tears ; I have taken infinite Pains to

ta my Eyes, an Objed, to whom the whole 
World ought to pay Adoration, how could I 
refift that powerful Impulfe, which forced me to 
love what appeared fo worthy of my Affeftion ? 

Call not, interrupted Arabella^ that an ir- 
refiftiblc Impulfe, which was only the Effe£l 
of thy own changing Humour : The fame Ex- 
cufe might be pleaded for all the Faults we fee

in their admirable Valour j you would now be 
either Hghing in your Cave for the Lofs of the

Had you perf^vered in your AfFedion, and con**

would, perhaps, ere this, have found her fleep«

recommend to his Confideration the Condu£l 
of thofe illuftriousPerfons I have named, to th^ 
end that, purfuing their Steps, he may arrive 
at their Glory and Happinefs, that is the Repu-

G^ir;^, laughing in bis -Turn; have a little 
Gompaflion upon me,* and confefs, that no- 
thing could be more unfortunate,- than * that 
damnM Slip I madie at the latter End of my

Since you have fo fertile an Inventbn, faid 
Sir Charles y you may eafily repair this Miftake. 
Ods-heart ! It is pity you-are not poorenough

Oh ! Sir, cried Sir George y I have Stock

than thofe that do. 

Upon my Soul^ Charles^ faid Sir Gargey 
thou art fuch an ill-natured Fellow, that I am 
afraid, thou wilt be fneering at me when I am 
gone ; and wilt endeavour, to perfuade Lady 
Bella ^ that not a Syllable of my Story is true.

to deprive me of my lawful Claim to the great

I do not know, faid Sir Charle$y whetlier

the incomparable Phllonice. > 

Sir George^ who underftood his Meaning, 
went home, to think of fome Means, by which 
h0 might draw himfelf out of the EmbarraflV 
ment he was in ; and Mr. Glanville^ as he had 
promifed, did not endeavour to undeceive Lady 
Bella^ with regard to the Hiftory he had feign- 
ed ; being very well fatisfied with his having 
put it out of his Power to make his AddreiTes 
to her, fince fhe now looked upon him as the 
Lover of Philonke. 

As for Sir Charles^ he did not penetrate into 
the Meaning of Sir George's Story ; and only 
imagined, that by relating fuch a Heap of Ad- 
ventures, he had a DeGgn to entertain the 
Company, and give a Proof of the Felicity of 
his Invention ; and Mifs GlanvilU^ who (up- 
pofed, he had been ridiculing her Coufin's 
ftrange Notions, was better pleafed with him 
than ever. 

Arabella^ however, was lefs fatisfied thaa 
any of them : She could not endure to fee fo 
brave a Knight, who drew his Birth from a 
Race of Kings, tarnifh the Glory of his gallanc 
Aftions by fo bafe a Perfidy. 

Alas! faid (he to herfelf. How much Rea- 
fon has the beautiful Philonice to accufe me for

Caufe, that the ungrateful Prince, on whom

thought the Solitude {he lived in, confirmed 
her in her abfurd and ridiculous Notions, de- 
fired his Father to pr efs her to go to London. 

Sir Charles complied with his Requeft, and 
carneftly intreated her to leave the Caftle, and 
fpend a few Months m Town. Her Year of 
IVlouming being now expired, (he confented to

pearance of three Highwaymen, well mounted, 
at a fmall Diftance. 

One of the Servants, who had firft fpied 
ihem, immediately rode up to the Coach ; and, 
for fear of alarming the Ladies, whifpered Mr. 
■Glam/ilU in the Ear. 

Sir Charles^ who was fitting next bis Son, and 
had heard it, cried out with too little Caution, 
How's this ? Are we in any Danger of being at*

Mr. Glanvillej without replying, jumped

.fcreamed out ; and, left her Father (hould fol- 
low, whipped into her Brother's Seat, and held 
him faft by the Coat. 

Arabilla^ being in a ftrange Confternation at

what was the Matter ; and , obferving Three or 
Four Men of a genteel Appearance, on Horfe-

without ofFering to advance 5

the Laws of Honour do not oblige you : We 
are not violently carried away, as you falfly

fons, who are our Friends and Relations. ; 

Hey-day ! cried Sir Charles y ftaring at her 
with great Surprize ; what's the Meaning of all 
this ? Do you think thefe Fellows will mind your 
fine Speeches, Nieee ? 

I hope they will. Sir, faid (he : Then, pulling 
her Coufm, fliew yourfelf, for Heaven's Sake, 
Mifs, purfued fhe, and fecond my Affiirances,

The Highwaymen, who were near enough 
to hear Arabella^ Voice, though they could 
not diftinguifh her Words, gazqd on her with 
great Surprize ; and, finding they would be very 
well received, thought fit to abandon their En- 
terprize, and galloped away as faft as they were 
able. Some of the Servants made a Motion to 
purfue them ; but Mr. Glanville forbad it ; and, 
entering again into the Coach, congratulated 
the Ladies upon the Efcape they had.

For Perfons of Quality, Sir, refumed Jra^^

with that of that fair Princefs. 

For the Gratification of that Wifti, Madam, 
faid Mr. Glanville^ itjs neceflary fome Perfoit 
ihould meet with a Misfortune, out of which 
you might be able to relieve him ; but I fuppofe 
the Benevolence of your Difpofition may be 
equally fatisfied with npt finding anyOccafion, 
as of exercifing it, when it is found. 

Though it be not my Fortune to meet with 
thofe Occafions, replied Arabella^ there is no 
Reafon to doubt but others do, who poflibly 
have lefs Inclination to afford their Afliftance 
than my^ilf : And it is poffible, if any other 
than the Princefs of Mejjina had happened to 
pafs by, when Hortenftus was in the Hands of 
the Thejfalians^ he would not have been ref- 
cued from the ignominious Death be was de« 
iiined to, merely for killing a Stork. 

How ! interrupted Sir Charles^ put a Man to 
Death for killing a Stork ! Ridiculous I Pray, in 
what Part of the World did that happen ? 
Among the Indians of America^ I fuppofe. 

No, Sir, faid Arabella, in Thejfaly ; the faireft 
Part in all Macedonia , famous for the beautiful 
Valley of Tempt, which excited the Curiofity 
of all Travellers whatever. 

No, not all, Madam, returned Sir Charles ; 
for I am acquainted with feveral Travellers, 
who never faw it, nor even mentioned it ; and 
if it is fo fanMxis as you fay, I am furprifed I 
never heard of it before. 

I don't know, faid Arabella, what thofe Tra- 
vellers thought, worthy of their Notice ; bur f 
am certain^' that if. any Chance (kouVi c^\\^v\^x

me into Macedonia, I would not leave it till I 
faw the Valley of Tempe^ (o celebrated by all 
the Poets and Hiftorians. 

Dear Coufm, cried Glanville^ who could 
hardly forbear fmiiing, what Chance, in the 
Name of Wonder, (hould take you into Ma* 
tedonia^ at fo great a Didance from your own 
Country ? 

And {oy faid Sir Charles^ this famous Valley 
of Tempe is in Turky. Why you muft be 
very fond of travelling, indeed, Lady Bella^ 
if you would go into the Great Mogul's Country, 
where the People are all Pagans, they fay, 
and worlhip the Devil. 

The Country my Coufm fpeaks of, faid Mr. 
Glanville, is in the Grand Signor's Domi- 
nions : The Great Mogul, you know. Sir — 

Well, interrupted Sir Charles^ the Great 
Mogul, or the Grand Signor, 1 know not 
ivhat you call him : But I hope my Niece does 
not propofe to go thither. 

Not unlefs I am forcibly carried thither, faid 
jtrabella ; but 1 do determine, if that Misfor- 
tune {hould ever happen to me, that I would, 
if poflible, vifit the Vale of Tempe^ which is 
in that Part of Greece they call Macedonia. 

Then 1 am perfuaded, replied Sir Charles^ 
you'll never fee that famous Valley you talk of; 
for it is not very likely you ibould be forcibly 
carried away into Turky. 

And why do you think it unlikely, that I 
Ihould be carried thither ? interrupted Arabella. 
Do not the fame Things happen now, that 
did formerly ? And is any thing more common, 
tlien Ladies being carried^ by their Raviibers, 

into 



Chap. 3- CLUIXOTE. 133 

into Countries far diftant from their own ? Maj 
not the fame Accidents happen to me, that hare 
happened to fo many illuftrious Ladies before 
me ? And may I not be carried into Macedonia 
by a Similitude of Deftiny with that of a great 
many beautiful PrincefTes, who, though born in 
the moft diftant Quarters of the World, chanced 
to meet at one time in the City of JUxandrla^ 
and related their miraculous Adventures to each 
other ? 

And it was for that very Purpofe they met. 
Madam, faid Mr. Glanville^ fmiling. 

Why, truly, faid Arabella^ it happened very 
luckily for each of them, that they were 
brought into a Place where they found fo many 
illuftrious Companions in Misfortune, to whom 
they might freely communicate their Adven- 
tures, which otherwife might, haply, have been 
concealed, or, at leaft, have been imperfedUy 
delivered down to us: However, added (he, 
fmiling, if I am carried into Macedonia^ and 
by that means have an Opportunity of vifit- 
ing the famous Vale of Tempe^ I ftiall take care 
not to draw the Reiientment of the Thejfalians 
upon mc, by an Indifcretion like that of //ir- 
tenjius. 

For be pleafed to know, Sir, faid {he, ad- 
dreffing hcrfelf to her Uncle, that his killing a 
Stork, however inconfiderable a Matter it may 
appear to us, was yet looked upon as a Crime 
of a very atrocious Nature among the Thef^ 
falians ; for they have a Law, which forbids, 
upon Pain of Death, the killing of Storks ;

TH I S Piece of Hiftory, with Sir ChtirUi^% 
Remarks upon it, brought them into 
Bath. Their Lodgings being provided before- 
hand, the Ladies retired to their different Cham- 
bers, to rcpofe themfelvcs after the Fatigue 
of their Journey, and did not meet again till 
Supper was on Table ; when Mifs Glan^ 
villi y who had eagerly enquired what Company 
was then in the Place, and heard there were * 
great many Perfons of Falbion juft arrived, 
prett Arabella to go to the Pump -Room the 
next Morning, aflliring her {he would &id a 
very agreeable Amufement. 

Arabella accordingly confented to accompany 
her; and, being told the Ladies went in an Un« 
drefs of a Morning, (he accommodated herfelf 
to the Cuftom, and went in a ne^igent Drefs ; 
but inftead of a Capuchin, H^ woie fomething 

like 



Chap. 4- QJJIXOTE. 135 

like a Veil, of black Gauze, which covered 
almoft all her Face, and Part of her Waift, and 
gave her a very flngular Appearance. > 

Mifs Glanville was too envious of her Cou- 
fin's Superiority in point of Beauty, to inform 
her of any Oddity in her Drcfs, which (he 
thought might expofe her to the Ridicule of 
thofe that faw her ; and Mr* Glanville was toa 
little a Critic in Ladies Apparel, to be fenfiblc 
that Arabella was not in the Fafhion ; and iihcc 
every thing fhe wore became her extremely^ 
he could not choofe but think (he dreft ad- 
mirably well : He handed her therefore, with a 
great deal of SatisfacStion, into the Pump- 
Room, which happened to be greatly crouded 
that Morning. 

The Attention of moft Part of the Compa- 
ny was immediately engaged by the Appear- 
ance Lady Bella made. Strangers are here moft 
ftri£lly criticized, and every new Objeft affords 
a delicious Feail: of Raillery and Scandal. 

The Ladies, alarmed at the Singularity of 
her Drefs, crouded together in Parties ; and 
the Words, Who can fhe be ? Strange Crea- 
ture ! Ridiculous ! and other Exclamations of 
the fame Kind, were whifpered very intelli- 
gibly. 

The Men were ftruck with her Figure, 
veiled as fhe was: Her fine Stature, the beauti« 
ful Turn of her Perfon, the Grace and Ele- 
gance of her Motion, attracted all their No- 
tice : The Phaenomena' of the Veil, however, 
gave them great Diflurbance . So lovely a Per- 
fon fcemed to promife the Ovt^ner had a Face

from their View : For Arabella^ at her En- 
trance into the Room, had pulled the Gauze 
quite over her Face, following therein the Cuf- 
tom of the Ladies in Clelia, and the Grand Cy^ 
rus^ who, in mixed Companies, always hid their 
Faces with great Care. 

The Wits, and Pretty-Fellows, railed at Ac 
envious Covering, and compared her to the 
Sun obfcured by a Cloud ; while the Beaux 
4etrCd the horrid Innovation, and exprefled a 
Fear, left it fhould grow into a Fafhion. 
. Some of the wifer Sort took her for a Fo- 
reigner ; others, of ftill more Sagacity, fuppofed 
her a Scots Lady, covered with her Plaid ; and 
a third Sort, infinitely wifer than either, con- 
eluded (he was a Spantjb Nun, that had efcaped 
from a Convent, and had not. yet quitted her 
Veil. 

Jrabella\, ignorant of the Diverfity of Opi- 
nions, to which her Appearance gave Rife, was 
taken up in difcourfmg with Mr. GlanvilU 
upon the medicinal Virtue of the Spring?, the 
Oeconomy of the Baths, the Nature of the 
Diverfions, and fuch other Topics, as the 
Objefts around them furnifhed her with. 

In the mean time, Mifs Glanville was got 
amidft a Croud of her Acquaintance, who had 
hardly paid the Civilities of a firft Meeting, be- 
fore they eagerly inquired, who that Lady (he 
brought with her was. 

. Mifs Glanville informed them, that (he was 
her Coufin, and Daughter to the deceafed Mar- 
quis of adding with a Sneer, That (he had 

been brought up in the Country; knew nothing 
of the World i and had fome very peculiar No-

tions, as you may fee, faid fhe, by that odd 
"kind of Covering (he wears. 

Her Name and Quality were prefently whlA 
pered all over the Room : The Men, hearing 
{he was a great Heirefs, found greater Beauties 
^o admire in her Ptrfon : The Ladies, aw'd 
by the Sanftion of Quality, dropt their Ridi- 
cule on her Drefs, and began to quote Exam- 
ples of Whims full as inexcufable. 

One remcmbred, that Lady J — T^ al- 
always wore her Ruffles reverfed j that the 
Countefs of went to Court in a Far- 
thingale ; that the Duchefsof — fataftride 

upon a Horfe ; and a' certain Lady of great 
Fortune, and nearly allied to Quality, becaufc 
"flie was not dignified with a Title, invented a 
new one for herfelf ; and direfted her Servants 
to fay in fpeaking to her, Tot/r Honourefs^ which

and 'tis probable they faid no more than they 
thought, concealed one of the fineft Faces ia 
ibe World. 

. Mifs GlanviUe had the Mortification to fee 
both the Gentlemen lb charmed with the Sight 
pf her Coufin's Face, that for a long time (he 
fat wholly neglected ^ but the Serioulnefs of her 
Sehaviour, giving fome little Difguft to the 
youngeft of them, who was what the Ladies 
call a Pretty- Fellow, a dear Creature, and the 
moft diverting Man in the World ; he applied 
bimfelf wholly to Mifs GkmfilUj and foon eiir 
gaged her in a particidar Converfation. 

Mr* Sdvitiy fo was the other Gentleman 
called, wasof a much graver Caft ; Heaffe£(ed

failed to, take all Opportunities of difplaying

tion to introduce as often as he could, he pafTed 
among many Perfons for one, who, by Appli-

EffeA on his Audience, and always procured 
him a great Degree of Attention. 

This Gentleman hitherto had no Opportu- 
nity of difpiaying his Knowlege of Hiftory, 
the Difcourie having wholly turned upon News, 
and othei^rifles ; when Arabella ^ after fome 
more Inquiries concerning the Place, remark- 
ed, that there was a very great DiiFerence be- 
tween the medicinal Waters at Bath^ and the 
fine Springs at the Foot of the Mountain Ther* 
mtpyla m Greecey as well in their Qualities, as 
manner of ufing them ; and I am of Opinion, 
added {he, that Bath^ famous as it is for re* 
ftoring Health, is lefs frequented by infirm 
Perfons, than the famous Springs o(Thermopyla 
were by the Beauties of Greece^ to whom thofe 
.Waters have the Reputation of giving new 
Luftre. 

Mr. Selvin^ who, with all his Reading, had 
never met with any Account of thefe celebrated 
Grecian Springs, was extremely difconcerted at 
not being able to continue a Converfation, 
which the Silence of the reft of the Company 
made him imagine, was direded wholly to 
bim. 

The Shame he conceived at feeing himfelf 
pofed by a Girl, in a Matter which fo imme- 
diately belonged to him, made him refolve to 
draw himfelf out of this Dilemma at any Rate; 
aud, though he was far from being convinced, 
that there were no fuch Springs at Thirmopyla as 
Arabella mentioned ; yet he refolutely main- 
tained, that fhe muft be miftaken in their Situa- 
tion \ fori to his certain Knowl^e, there were 

u no

•no medicinal Waters at the Foot of that Moun- 
tain. 

■ Arabella J who could not endure to be con- 
tradicted in what {he took to be fo inconteft- 
able a Fa6l, reddened with Vexation at his un- 
cxpeded Denial. 

It fhould feem, faid (he, by your Difcourfe, 
that you are unacquainted with many material 
'PafTages, that paiied among very illuftrious 
Per Ions there 5 and if you knew any thing of 
Pijijiratus the Athenian^ you would know, that 
.an Adventure he had at thofe Baths, laid the 
Foundation of all thofe great Defigns, which he 
afterwards efFedled, to the total Subverfion of 
the Athenian Government. 

Mr. Selvin^ furprifed that this Piece of Hi- 
ftory had likewife efcaped his Obfervation, re- 
folved, however, not to give up his Point. 

I think. Madam, replied he, with great 
Self-fufEciency, that I am pretty well acquaint- 
Jtd with every thing which relates to the Af- 
fairs of the Athenian Commonwealth ; and know 
by what Steps Pifijiratus advanced himfelf to 
the Sovereignty. It was a great Stroke of Po- 
licy in him, faid he, turning to Mr. GlanvilU^ 
indeed, to wound himfelf, in order to get a 
-Guard affigned him, 

• You are miftaken. Sir, faid Arabella^ if you 
.believe, there was any Truth in the Report of 
bis having wounded himfelf: It was done, either 
by his Rival Lycurgus or l%eocrites ; who be- 
lieving him ftill to be in Love with the fair 
Cerinthe^ whom he courted, took that Way to 
£et rid of him : Neither is it true, that Am- 
bition alone infpired Piftfiratm with a Defign of 

enflaving 



Chap.j. QUIXOTE. 141 

cnflaving his Country: Thofe Authors who fay 
fo, muft know little of the Springs and Motives' 
of his Condu£i:. It was neither Ambition nor 
Revenge, that made him ad as he did ; it was 
the violent AfFe£tion he conceived for the beau- 
tiful Chorantiy whom he firft faw at the famous 
Baths of Thermopylae which put him upon thofe 
Defigns; for, feeing thsLt Lycurgus, who was 
not his Rival in Ambition, but Love, would 
certainly become the Poffeflbr of Chorante, un- 
kfs he made himfelf Tyrant oi Athens j he had 
recourfe to that violent Method, in order to 
preferve her for himfelf. 

I proteft, Madam, faid Mr. Selvin^ calling 
down his Eyes in great Confuiion at her fu- 
perior Knowlege in Hiftory, thefe Particu- 
lars have all efcaped my Notice \ and this is the 
firft time I ever underftood, ihztPiJiJiratusvms 
violently in Love ; and that it was not Ambi- 
tion, which made him afpire to Sovereignty. « 

I do not remember any Mention of this in 
Plutarch i continued he, rubbing his Forehead, 
or any of the Authors who have treated on the 
Affairs of Greece. 

Very likely, Sir, replied Arahella ; but you 
will fee the whole Story of Pijiftratus^s Love 
for Chorante, with the Effefts it produced, re- 
lated at large in Scudery, 

Scuderyj Madam ! faid the fage Mr. Selvin^ 
I never read thatHiftorian. 

No, Sir ! replied Arabella^ then ycfur Read- 
ing has been very confined. 

I know. Madam, faid he, that Herodotus^ 
Thucydidesj and Plutarch, h^ve indeed quoted 
him frequentl/. 



14a The FEMALE BookVn. 

I am furprifed, Sir, faid Mr. GlanvilUj who 
was excels vely diverted at this Difcovery of 
Us great Ignorance and Affedation, that you 
have not read that famous Hiftorian ; efpeciallyy 
as the Writers you have mentioned quote him 
lb often. 

Why, to tell you the Truth, Sir, faid he; 
diough be was a Rmum ; yet it is objeAed to 
him, that he wrote but indifierent Latin i with 
no Purity or Elegance ; and — 

You are quite miftaken. Sir, interrupted 
JbrabeUa ; the great Scudery was a Frenchman ; 
and both his Cklia and Artamems were written 
in French. 

A Frenchman was he ? faid Mr. Sehtn^ with 
a lofty Air: Oh! then, 'tis not furprifing, 
that I have not read him : I read no Authors, 
hut the Antients, Madam, added he, with a 
Look of Self-applaufe ; I cannot reliih the Mo- 
derns at all : I have no Tafte for their Way of 
Writing. 

But Scudery muft needs be more ancient 
than ThkcydideSj and the reft of thofe Greei 
Hiftorians you mentioned, faid Mr. GlanviUe: 
How elfe could they quote him ? 

Mr. Sehin was here fo utterly at a Lofs, that 
he could not conceal his Confufion : He held 
down his Head, and continued filent ; while the 
Beau, who had liftened to the latter Part of their 
Difcourfe ; exerted his fuppofed Talent of 
Raillery againft the unhappy Admirer of the 
antient Authors ; and increafed his Confufion 
by a tboufand Sarcafms, which gave more Di- 
vcrfion to himfclf^ than any body elfe.

Chap. VI. 

ff^bicb contains fome excellent Rules faf 

Raillery. 

MR. Glanvilkj who had too much Polite- 
nefs and Good nature to infift too long 
upon the Ridicule in the CIiara£ter of his Ac- 
quaintance, changed the Difcourfe : And Jrar 
bella^ who had obferved, with fome ConcerHf 
the ill-judged Raillery of the young Beau, took 
Occafion to decry that Species of Wit ; and 
gave it as her Opinion, that it was very dan* 
gerous and unplealing. 

For, truly, faid flie, it is alnioft impoffible 
to ufe it without being hated or feared ; and 
whoever gets a Habit of it, is in Danger of 
wronging all the Laws of Friendfhip and Hu- 
manity. 

Certainly, purfued ihe, looking at the Beau, ^ 
it is extremely unjuft to rallly one's Friends, and 
particular Acquaintance : Firft, choofe them well, 
and be as nice is you pleafe in the Choice ; but 
when you have chofen them, by no means play 
upon them : 'Tis cruel and malicious, to di- 
vert one's felf at the Expence of one's Friend. 

However,. Madam, faid Mr. Glanvilley who 
was charmed to hear her talk fo ratiorfally, you 
may give People Leave to railly their Ene- 
mies. 

Truly, refumed Arabella, I cannot allow 
that, any more than upon Friends; forRaillerj 
is the pooreft kind of Revenge th^l C2^tv>a^ \3^K.^ti\ 



144 7X^ F E M A L E Book VII. 

Methinks, it is mean to railly Perfons who 
have a final! Share of Merit; fince, haply, their 
Defeds were born with them, and not of their 
own acquiring ; and it is great Injuftice to def- 
canC upon one flight Fault in Men of Parts, to 
the Prejudice of a thouland good Qualities. 

For aught I fee. Madam, faid the Beau, you 
will not allow one to railly any body. 

I am of Opinion, Sir, faid Arabella^ that 
there are very few proper Obje£k for Raillery; 
and ftill fewer, who can railly well : The Ta- 
lent of Raillery ought to be born with a Per- 
fon; no Art can infufe it ; and thofe who en- 
deavour to railly in fpite of Nature, will be fo 
far from diverting others, that they will become 
theObje£b of Ridicule themfelves. 

Many other pleating Qualities of Wit may 
be acquired by Pains and Study, but Raillery 
muft be the Gift of Nature : It is not enough 
to have many lively and agreeable Thoughts ; 
Sut there muft be luch an Expreflion, as muft 
convey their full Force and Meaning ; the 
*Air the Afped, the Tone of the Voice, and 
every Part in general, muft contribute to its 
Perfedlion. 

There ought alfo to be a great Diftance be-^ 
iween Raillery and Satire, fo that one may ne- 
ver be miftaken for the other : Raillery ought 
indeed to furprife, and feniibly touch, thofe to 
whom it is direAed ; but I would not have the 
Wounds it makes, either deep or lafling : Let 
thofe who feel it, be hurt like Perfons, who, 
gathering Rofes, are pricked by the Thorns, 
and find a fweet Smell to make amends. 

I would 
6 



Chap.(f. QUIXOTE. 145 

I would have Raillery raife the Fancy, an.d 
quicken the Imagination, the Fire of its Wit 
ihould only enable us to trace its Original, 
and fhine as the Stars do, but not burn. 
Yet, after all, I cannot greatly approve oC 
Raillery, or ceafe to think it dangerous ; and,, 
to purfue my Comparifon, faid (he, with an 
inchanting Smile, Perfons who poflefs the 
true Talent of Raillery, are like Comets ; they 
are feldom feen, and are at once admir'd and 
fear'd. 

I proteft, Lady Bella^ faid Sir Churlis^ who 
had liften'd to her with many Signs. of Admi« 
ration, you fpeak like an Orator. 

One would not imagine, interrupted Mr. 
Glanvilbj who faw Arabella in fome Confulion 
at the coarfe Praife her Uncle gave her, that 
my Coufin could fpeak fo accurately of a Qua* 
lity (he never pra£tlfes : And 'tis eafy to judge 
by what (he has faid, that no body can raitly 
finer than herfelf, if (he pleafes. 

Mr. Selvirij tho' he bore her a Grudge fot 
knowing more Hiftory than he did, yet aiTur'd 
)ier, that (he had given the beft Rules imagin- 
able for raillying well. But the Beau, whom 
(he had lilenc'd by her Reproof, was extremely 
angry \ and, fuppofing it would mortify her to 
fee him pay Court to her Coufin, be redoubled 
his Aifiduities to Mifs Glanville^ who was highly

You can never pcrfuade me, faid Arabella^

Two thoufand Years ! Madam, faid the Wo-

people, if they did ftot alter a thoufand Times 
in as many Days ! I thought your Ladyfhip 
Was fpeaking of the laft Month's Tafte j^ which, 
as I faid before, is quite out now. 
' Well, replied Arabella j let the prefent Mode 
be what it will, I infift upon having my Cloaths 
made after the Pattern of the beautiful Daugh- 
ter of Augujius \ being convinced, that none 
other can be half fo becoming. 

What Faftiion was that, pray, Madam, faii 
the Woman ? I never faw it. 

How, replied Arabella^ Have you already for- 
got the Fafliion of the Princefs Julians Robe, 
which you faid was wore but laft Month ? Or, 
are y^u ignorant that the Piincefe Julla^ and 
the Daughter of Augufius^ is the fame Perfon ? 

I proteft. Madam, faid the Woman, ex- 
tremely Gonfus*d, I had forgot that, till you 
called it to my Mind. 

Well, faid Arabella^ make me a Robe in the

The Mantua-maker was now wholly at a 
Loft in what Manner to behave ; for^ being 
confcious that ftie knew nothing of the Princefii

to her ufual Expedient, which was, to make 
one of hf r Women, who undcrftood a little of 
the Mantua-making Bufinels, make a Robe for 
her, after her own Diredions. 

Miis Glanviliey who imagined {he had (ent 
for Work-women, in order to have Ckaths 
made in the modern Tafte, was furpriz*d at her 
Entrance into her Chamber, to iee her dreffing 
fer the Ball, in a Habit fingular to the laft 
Degree. 

She wore no Hoop, and the Blue and Silver 
Stuff of her Robe, was only kept by its own 
Richnefs, from banging dofe about her. It 
was quite open round her Breaft, which was 
Ibaded with a rich Border of Lface ; and clafp- 
ing dofe to her Waift, by fmall Knots of Dia- 
monds, defcended in a fweepkig Train on the 
Ground. 

The Sleeves were (hort, wide, and flafh'd, 
faftned in different Plaees with Diamonds, and 
ber Arms were partly hid by half a Dozen Falls 
of Ruffles. Her Hair, which fell in very eafy 
Ringlets on her Neck, was plac'd with great 
Qzre and ExaAnefs round her lovely Face ; and 
the Jewels and Ribbons, which were all her 
Hea^-drefi, difpos'd to the greateft Advanta^. 

Upon the whole, nothing could be more fin- 
gularly becoming than her Drefs ; or fet ofF 
with greater Advantage the ftriking Beauties of 
her Perfbn. 

' Miis GknvUkj tho' fhe was not difpleasM to 
fee her perdfl in her Singularity of Drefs ; yet 
could not behold her look fo lovdy in it, with- 
out feeling a fecrct Uneafinefs \ but confoling

approv'd her Tafte in the Choiccof her Co- 
lours, and went with her at the ufual ' Hour, 
to the Rooms, attended by Mr. GlanvilU^ 
Mr. Sehiriy and the young Beau we have for- 
merly mentioned. 

The Surprize Arabella's uuufual Appearance 
gave to the whole Company, was very vifible 
to every one but herfelf. 

The Moment (he enter'd the Room, every 
one whifper'd the Pcrfon next to them ; and for 
fome Moments, nothing was heard but the 
Words, the Princefs Julia ; which was eccho*J 
at every Corner, and at lafl attracted her Ob- 
fervation. 

Mr. Glaftville, and the reft of the Company 
with her, were in fome Confufion at fhe uni- 
verial Exclamation, which they imagined was 
occafion*d by the Singularity of her Habit ; 
tho* they could not conceive, why they gave 
her that Title. Had they known the Adven- 
ture of the Mantua-maker, it would doubtlcfs 
have eafily occurt'd to them ; for the Woma» 
had no fooner left Arabella^ than (be related 
the Conference (he had with a Lady newly ar- 
riv'd, who had required her to make a Robe ia 
the Manner of the Princefs JuHa^ ; and dif- 
mifs'd her, becaufe (he did not underftand the ^ 
Fa(hions that prevailed two thoufand Years ago. 

This Story was quickly difpers'd, and for its 
Novelty, afforded a great deal of Diverfion ; 
every one long'd to fee a Fa(hion of fuch An- 
tiquity ; and expeAcd the Appearance of the 
Princcfe Julia with great Impatience.

It IS not to be doubted but much Mirth was 
treafur'd up for her Appearance ; and the occa* 
fiona] Humourift had already prepared his ac- 
cuftom*d Jtft, when the Sight of the devoted 
fair One repellM his Vivacity, and the defign^d 
Ridicule of the whole Aflembly. 

Scarce had trefirft tumultous Whifpcrefcap'd 
the Lips of each Individual, when they found 
themfelves aw'd to Refped by that irreflftable 
Charm in the Perfc n of Arabella^ which com- 
manded Reverence and Love from all who be-

Her noble Air, the native Dignity in her 
I-KX)ks, the inexpreffible Grace which accom- 
pany'd all her Motions, and the confummate 
Lovelinefs of her Form, drew the Admiration 
of the whole Affembly. 

A refpeftful Silence fucceedecj, and the Afto-

in Confidence all that had pafs'd between him 
and the Princeis Julian x^kn which nothing 
could be more innocent tho' a little indifcreet. 
For, 'tis certain that (he permitted him to love

Mr. Sehiftj not daring to contradid a Lady 
whofeextenfive Reading had furnifh'd her with 
Anecdotes unknown almoft to any Body elfe,

Mr. GlanvilUj who knew all thefe Anecdotes 
were drawn from Romances, which he found 
contradi£ted the known Fadls in Hiftory, and 
affignM the mcft ridiculous Cauies for Things 
of the greateft Importance ; could not help 
fmiling at the Facility with which Mr. Sibnn 
gave int« thofe idle A surdities. For notwith- 
itanding his Aifedation of great Reading, his 
fuperficial Knowledge of Hiftory made it ex- 
tremely eaiy to deceive him ; and as it was his 
Cuftom to mark in his Pocket- Book all the 
Scraps of Hiftory he heard introduced into Con- 
verfation, and retail them again in other Com- 
pany ; he did not doubt but he would make a

Mr. Tin/el was charm'd with aRequeft which 
afforded him an Opportunity of gratifying a fa- 
vourite Inclination, and feating himfelf near

Injunftions, when (he gracefully intrcated him

After this Arahlla turned gravely about ta

be depended on. 

Perhaps, faid Arabella^ the Lady is one of your 
Acquaintances, and favour'd you with the Re-^ 
citalof her Adventures from her own Mouth. 

No, really. Madam, anfwer'd Mr. ^infely 
furpriz'd at the great Simplicity of Arabella^: 
for fo he underftood it ; the Lady, I believe, is 
not fo communicative : And to fay the Truth, 
I (hould not chufeto hear her Adventures from 
herfelf, fince (he certainly would fupprefs the 
moft material Circumftances. 

In a Word, faid he, lowering his Voice,. 
That Lady was for many Years the Miftrefs of 
a young military Nobleman, whom fhe was fo» 
oomplaifant to £ojlow in all his 'Campaigns^ 
Marches, Sieges, and every Inconveniency of 
War : He married her in Gibraltar j from 
whence he is lately arriv'd, and introduced his 
new Lady to his noble Brother, by whom fhe 
was not unfavourably receiv'd. 'Tis worth* 
remarking, that this fame haughty Peer thought 
fit to refcnt with implacable Obftinacy, the 
Marriage of another of his Brothers, . with the 
Widow of a brave Officer, of confiderable 
Rank in the Army, 'Tis true, (he was feverat 
Years older than the young Lord, and hid n© 
Fortune ; but the Duke affign'd other Reafons 
for his Difpleafure : He complain'd loudly, that 
his Brother had difhonourM the Nobility of his 
Birth, by this Alliance, and continued his Re-

gave many remarkable Proofs of his Courage 
and Fortitude upon feveral Occafions, and died

leaving his difconiblate Ladjr a Widow a (c«

indeed, but a verj fmali Addition to her For-

Obferve that gaj, fplendid hsuiy^ I befeech

bow affe£ledly (he looks and talks, and throws 
ker Eyes around the Room, vritfa a haughty^ 
Self-fufficiency in her Afped, and infolent Con-

kk, her Speech^ her Motions, are all French ; 
nothing in England is able to pleafe her ; the 
People fo dull, fo aukwardly polite, the Man- 
ners {o grofs J no Delicacy, no Elegance, no 
Magnificence in their Perfons, Houfo, or Di- 
ver fions ; every Thing is fo diflafleful, there

fine Lady was a Pcrfon of very exalted Rank,,

her of attending new Lodgers to their Apart-

niences of the Piace, anfwering an humble 
Queftion or two concerning what Company 
was in the Town, what Scandal was ftixring^ 
^nCk the like,. 



Chap. 8. QUIXOTE. ijr 

One of our great Sea Commanders going 
thither for his Health, happened to lodge at this 
Inn ; and was fo ftruck with her Charms, that 
he marry'd her in a few Weeks, and foon after 
brought her to England. *^ 

Such was the Origin of this iantafttck Ladfs 
whofe infupportable Pride and ridiciilbus Af- 
fefbtion, draws Contempt and Averfion where* 
flie appears. 

Did I not tell 3K)u, Madam^ interrupted 
Mr. Glanville^ that the Amufement you had 
chofe was not fo innocent as Dancing ? What a 
deal of Scandal has Mr. Ttn/el utterM in the 
Compafs of a few Minutes ? 

I afllire you, replied ArAella^ I know not . 
what to make of the Hiftories he has been re* 
lating. I think they do not delerve that Name» 
and are rather detatched Pieces of Satire on 
particular Perfons, than a ferious Relation of 
Fads. I confefs my £xpe£btiona from this- 
Gentleman have not been anfwer'd.

Merit in the Relations Mr. Tinfel has made % 
for, if he has not (hewn us any Thing to ap- 
prove, he has at leaft (hewn us what to condemn •. 
The Uglinefe of Vice, reply*d Arabella^ 
ought only to be reprefented to ^the Vicious j 
to whom Satire, like a magnifying Glafs, may 
aggravate every Defed, in order to make it» 
Deformity appear more hideous ;. but finee it» 
End is enly to reprove and amend, it (hould 
never be addref&M to any but thole who come 
within its Corredbn, and may be the better

tbe Deformity of Vice, to make it be bated and 
avoided ; the more pure and uncorrupted our 
Idjeas are, the*(e(s (hall we be influenc'd by Ex- 
ample. A natural Propenfity to Virtue or 
Vice often determines the Choice : *Tis fufE- 
cient therefore to (hew a good Mind what it 
ought to purfue, though a Ixid one muft be told 
what to avoid. In a Word, one ought to be 
always incited, the other always reftrain'd. 

I vow. Lady Belky iaid Mifs Glanvilky 
you'd make one think one came here to hear a 
Sermon ; you are fb very grave, and talk upoa 
fuch high-flown Subjects. What Harm was 
there in what Mr. Ttnfel was telling us ? It 
would be hard indeed, if one might not divert 
one's felf with other Peoples Faults. 

I am afraid, ^Mifs, iaid Arahelloy thofe who 
can divert themfelves with the Faults of others, 
are not behind hand in affording Diverfion. 
And that very Inclination, added (he, fmilingly,. 
to hear other Peoples Faults, may by thofe very 
People, be condemned as one, and afford them

Why pray, faid Mils Glanville? What Kind 
of Amufemeats did your Ladyfhip expeS to 
ind in the World ? And what was there dif- 
stgreeable In your Entertainpient to Night ? I 
am fure there is no Place in England^ except 
London J where there is fe much good Company 
to be met with, as here. The Affembly was 
very numerous and brillant, and one can be at 
no Lo(s for Amufements : The Pump- Room in 
the Morning, the Parade, and the Rooms, in 
the Evening, with little occafional Parties of 
Pleafure, will find one fufficient Employment^ 
and leave none of one's Time to lye ufelefs up- 
on one's Hand. 

I am of Opinion, replied Arabelb^ that 
one's Time is far from being well employed in 
the Manner you portion it out : And People 
who fpend theirs in fuch trifling Amufements^ 
muft certainly live to very little Purpofe. 

What room, I pray you, does a Lady give 
for high and noble Adventures, who confumes 
her I>ays in Drefling, Dancing, liftening to 
Songs, and ranging the Walks with People as 
thoughtlefs as herfelf ? How mean and con- 
temptible a Figure muft a Life fpent in fuch idle 
Amufements make in Hiftory ? Or rather, Are 
not fuch Perfons always buried in Oblivion^ 
and can any Pen be found who would conde* 
fcend to record fuch inconfiderable A£tions }

are always talking pf Battles and Fighting. Do 
you expefl that Perfons of Quality, and fine 
Gentlemen, will go to the Wars f What Bj- 
finefs have they to fight ? That belongs to the 
Officers. 

Then every fine Gentleman is an Officer, 
faid AraheUa ; and fome other Title ought to

Dance and Drefs. 

I could never have imagined, interrupted 
Mr. 7/«/r/, furvcying AraheUa^ that a Lady {o

I afTure you. Sir, replied AraheUa^ I have 
an Averfion to neither : On the contrary, I 
am a great Admirer of both. But my Ideas 
of Amufements and Grandeur are probably 
different from yours. 

I will allow the Ladies to be follidtous about 
their Habits, and drefs with all the Care and 
Elegance they are capable of ; but fuch Trifles 
are below the Confideration of a Man, who 
ought not to owe the Dignity of his Appear- 
ance to the Embroidery on his Coat, but to 
hit high and noble Air, the Grandeur of his 
Courage, the Elevation of his Sentiments, and 
the many heroick AAlonshe has perform'd. 

Such a Man will drefs his Perfon with a 

graceful Simplicity, and lavifh all bis Gold and 

^Embroidery upon his Armour, to render him 

confpicueus in the Day of Battle, The Plumes 

'm bjs Helmet will look more graceful in the

Field, than the Feather in his Hat at a Ball ; 
and Jeweljs blaze with 'more Propriety on his 
Shield and Cuirafs in Battle, than glittering on 
his Finger in a Dance. 

Do riot, imagine, however, purfucd fee, that 
I abfolutcly condemn Dancing, and think it a 
Diverfion whol'y unworthy of a Hero. 

Hiftory has recorded fome very famous Balls, 
at which the moft illuftrious Perfons in the 
World have appeared. 

Cyrus the Great, we are informed, open**! a 
Ball with the divine Mandana at Sardis. The 
renown'd King of Scythia danced with the 
Princefs Cleopatra at Alexandria. The brave 
Cleomedm with the hit Candace at Ethiopia ; 
but thefe Diverflons were taken but feldom, 
and confider'd indeed as an Amufement, not as 
a Part of the Bufinefs of Life. 

How would fo many glorious Battles have 
been fought. Cities t^ken. Ladies refcuM, and 
other great and noble Adventures been atchiev'd, 
if ^ Men, funk in Sloth and Effeminacy, had 
continually foMow'd the Sound of a Fiddle, 
faunter'd in Publick Walks, and tattled over a 
Tea-table. 

I vow, Coufin, faid Mife Glanville^ you are 
infinitely more fevere in yowr Cenfures than 
Mr. 7infel was at the AfTcmbly. You had lit- 
tle Reafon mfthinks to be angry with him. 

All I have faid, reply'd Arahella^ were th^ 
riatural Inference from your own Account of 
the Manner in which People live here. When 
Aftions are a Cenfure upon themfelves, the Re* 
citcr will always be confider'd as a Satirift.

MR. SelvinznilAi. Tmjely who had lificn'd

no Knowledge of the WorM, and Mr. Sehnn 
convinced (be was a Wit, and very Icarn'd ia 
Antiquity. 

Certainly, (aid Mr. Sehiriy in Support of his 
Opinion, the Lady has great Judgment ; has 
been capable of prodigious Application, as b 
apparent by her extenfive Reading : Then her 
Memory is quite miraculous. I proteft, I am 
quite charm'd with her : I never met with 
fuch a Woman in my Life. 

Her Coufin, in my Opinion, reply'd Mr* 
Tmfil^ is infinitely beyond her in every Merit, 
but Beauty. How fprightly and free her Con- 
verlation? What a thorough Knowledge of 
the World ? So true a Tafte for polite Amufe- 
ments, and a Fumd of Spirits that fets Vapours 
and Spleen at Defiance. 

This Speech bringing on a Comparifon be-

fo warm in the Difpute, that they had like t%

Reading and the Labours of the Toilet em-

confefs'd to her Honour, that the latter en- 
grofs'd but a very fmafll Part of it. 

Mils GlanvilUf with whom the Beau had a 
^ long Converfation at one of the Windows ;

Thi» 16 the moft common Way in which 
fucb DeclarationB are, and ought to be brought 
about. However, there are others, which are 
as well calculated for fparin^ a Lady's Confo— 
iion, and deprecating her Wrath. 

The Lover, for Example, lik« the Prince? 
of the Majfagetet^ after having buried his PaC- 
fion in Silence for many Years, may chance to 
^be walking with his Confidant in a retir'd 
Place 5 to whom, with a Deluge of Tears, he 
rentes the EicceGi of his P^flion and Dcfpair. 
And while he is thus unbofoming his Griefs, 
not in the Icaft fttfpe<Sting he is overheard, his 
Piincefs, who had been liftning to him in muck 
Trouble and Confufion, by ibme little Ruftling 
(he makes, unawares difcovers herfelf. 

The furprizM Lover throws himfelf at her 
Feet, begs Pardon for his Rafbneis, obfefvcs 
that he had never prefum'd to difoover. his 
Paffion to her ; and implores her Leave to die 
before her, as a Punifhment for his undefign'd 
Oftence. 

The Method which the great Artameues took 
to let* the Princefe of Media know he adored 
her, was not Itfsrcfpcftful. This valiant Prince, 
who had long loved her, being to fight a great 
Battle, in which he had fome fecret Prefageshe 
fiiould fall, which liowever deceived him, wrote 
a long Letter to the divine Mandana'^ wherein 
he difcovcr'd his Paffion, and the Refolution his 
Refpcfi had inijpir'd him with, to confume ia 
Silence, and never prefume to difclcfc his Love 
while he lived; acquainting her, that he had

' He prefents her the Letter, which flie makes*

more. She reads it, and her whole Soul i^ 
melted with Compaffion ; (he bewails his Fate- 
with the moft tender and aSe£tionate Marks of 
Grief. 

Hef Confidant asks why (he is fo much af- 
fe6ted, jCnce in all Rrobability, (he would not

Madam, you are certainly miftaken. You letf 
Mn Silvin utterly denies, the Crkike of loving 
you. He has fiifier'd very innocently in your 
Opinion. Indeed, yoor Ladyfliip was too ba%!! 
in condemning him. 

If what be (ays be true, lepIieJ JrabiHa^ 
who had been in extream Confufidh, while a

fokitely a Man denies his Paifion, the more

^hen Mr, Silvtrf% Paflion is certainly very

Imprudent Girl, cried jtrabella^ for I am 
loth to fufpe£t thee of Difloyalty to thy Miftrefi. 
Doft thou know the Nature and Extent of the 
Requeft thou haft delivered ? Art thou ignorant 
that the prefuraptuous Man whom thou folliciteft 
this Favour for, has mortally offended me i 

Indeed, Madam, faid Lucy frighted out of 
her Wits, I don't ibllicit for him. I fcorn to do 
any fuch Thing, I would not offend your 
LadyOitp for the World ■: For, before I would • 
deliver his Mefl&gc to your Ladyfhip, I mad»

your Ladyflaip.

Well, well, faid Sir Charles^ he Is departed in

How, Sir, interrupted Arabella^ is he dead 
then already ? Alas! why had he not the Satis- 
fadion of feeing me before he expir'd, that his 
Soul might have departed in Peace ! He would 
have, been aflUr'd not only of my Pardon, but 
Pity alib; and that AfTurance would have made 
bim happy in his lail Moments. 

Why, Niece, interrupted Sir Charles ftaring, 
you furprize me prodigioufly : Are you in

a Cdmmillion of Lunacy againft her, lather 
than marry her to his Son, whom he was per- 
fuaded could never be happy with a Wife (b un- 
accountably abfurd. Tho' he only hinted at 
this to Mr. GlanvilUj in a Converfation he had 
with him while his' Diflatisfa^tion was at its 
Height, conctoiing Arabella j yet the bare Sup- 
pefition that his Father evrr thought of fuch a

Agonies, that Sir Charles to compofe him, pro- 
tefted he would do nothing in relation to his 
Niece that he would not approve of. Yet he 
expoftulated with him on the Abfurdity of her 
Bchaviou.r, and the Ridicule to which i^^ CX- 
pu&M herfelf wherever (he went ; appealing to 
him, whether in a Wife he could think thqfe 
FolHes fupportable, which in a MiArefs occa- 
(ion'd him io much Confufion.

a few Weeks to Richmond^ where he hirM a

fo my native Country, when paiEng thro' this 
Foreft I was feiz'd with an Inclination to deep. 
I had ty*d my Horfc to aTree, and retiring 
fomc few Paces off, ftretch'd myfelf at the Foet 
of a large Oak wbofe Branches promised -me an 
agreeable Shade. I had not yet clos'd my Eyes, 
when the Slumber I invited was diffipated by 
the Sound of fome Voices near me. 
' A Curiofity, not natural tome, made me 
Kften to thcDifcourfe of thefe Perfons, whom by 
the T'one of their Voices, tho' I could not fee 
them, I knew to be Men. 

In fhort, Madam, I was a Witne& to a moft 
horrible Scheme which they concerted together; 
my Weaknefs will not permit me to enter into 
an exa£l Detail of all I heard : The Refult of 
their Conference was. To fcize the Princefs of 
this Country and carry her off. 

Here, purfued Cynecia^ I interrupted thie 
Stranger with a loud Cry, which giving him 
to undcrftand who I was, be apologii'd in the 
moft graceful Maimer imaginable for the little 
Refped he had hitherto piid me. 

I then intreated him to tell me. If he had any 
Opportunity of hearing the Name of my defign'd 
fiavifher; to which he repiy^d,- that he under* 
ftood it to be TaxaruUr. 

This Man, Madam, was one of my Father's 
Favourites, and had been long fecretly in Love 
with me. 

Jriamenes then informM me, that being en- 

flam'd with Rage ag^ft thefe impious Villains, 

he roft from the Ground, re-mounted his Horfe, 

and ddfi the two Traytors akMid, threatning

Vi^rjr, yet 'gave me to underftand that he had ' 
made both the Villains abandon their wicked En* 
terprize, with their Lives ; and that difmount- 
ing in order to fee if they were quite dead, Ix; 
found himfelf (b faint with the Wounds he had 
received from them botb^ that he had not 
Strength to re-mount his Horfe ; but crawling 
on, in Hopes of meeting with fome AiTiftance, 
fainted away at laft through WearineG and Lofs 
of Blood, 

While he was giving me this Account, the 
Chariot I had fent for arrived, and having made 
him fuch Acknowledgments as the Obligation 
I had received from him demanded, I c^s'd 
him to get into the Chariot, and fending one 
with him to acquaint the Prince my Father 
with all that had happened, and the Merit of 
the valiant Stranger, I returned thcf lame Way 
I came with my Women, my Thoughts being 
wlK>lly engrois'd by this Unknown. 

The Service he had done me flU'd me with a 
Gratitude and Efteem for him, which piepar'd 
my Heart for thofe tender Sentiments I after- 
wards cntertain'd to the Ruin of my Repofe. 

I will not tire your Patience, Madam, with 
a minute Detail of all the fucceeding Pafiages 
of my Story i it (hall fuffice to tell you. That

me, and gave him that Share in ray Heari^ 
which I fear not all his Infidelities will ever de- 
prive him of. 

His Attachment to me was foon fufpeAeA by 
^axander^s Relations, who having fecretlir

bad admitted his Addrefles, and having made 
them f:r Ives Matters of our Secrets, by means of 
the Treachery of one of my Women, procured 
Information to be given to my Father of our

Alas ! what Mifchiefs did not this fatal Dif- 
covery produce : My Father, enrag*d to the

his Dominions within three Days. 

Spare me. Madam, the Repetition of what 
pafs'd at our laft fad Interview, which by large 
Bribes to my Guards, be obtain'd. 

His Tears, his Agonies, his Vows of ever-

parting with him, and perfuaded me of his 
Conftancy, that I waited for feveral Months 
with perftfl Tranquillity for the Performance 
of the Promife he made me, to do my Father 
fuch confiderable Services in the War he was

4fcver immediately, and retiring to hisown Apart- 
ment, endeavour'd to recall to his Memory s^l 
Xady fi<£W had iaid. 

The Ambiguity of her Style^ which bad led 
him into a Sufpicfon be had never entertained 
before, her laft Words had partly explained, if 
jfi he underfiood (he did, (he meant him by 
Ariamme$. Taking this for granted, he eaiily 
conceivM fome Plot grounded on her Roman- 
tick Noticms had been laid, to prepoflefs her 
againft him. 

. Sir Georg^^ Behaviour to her rufli'd that Mo- 
ment into his Thoughts: He infiantly recolkfled 
all his Fooleries, his Hiftory, his Letter, his 
Converfation, all apparently copied from thofe 
Books (he was (b fond of, and probably done 
with a View to (bme other Defign upon her. 

The(e Re(ie£tions, jein'd to his hew awak*d 
Sufpicions, that he was in Love with her, con* 
vinc'd him he was the Author of their prefent 
Mif-underftanding \ and that he had impos'd 
feme new Fallacy upon ArabtUa^ in order to 
promote a Quarrel between them. 

Fir'd almoft to Madneis at this Thought, he 
(lamp'd about his Room, vowing Revenge up- 
on Sir George^ execrating Romances, and cuff- 
ing his own Stupidity for not difcovering Sir 
George was his Rival, and knowing his plotting 
Talent, not providing againft his Artifices.

Moftieilt's Confidcratioh convinced him, tihat 
was not the moft probable Place to find him irt, 
fin(?e it was much more likciy he was waiting 
the Succftfs of his Schemes in London^ or perhaps 
at Richmond, 

Next to fatiatiftg his Vengeance, ihe Pleafure 
6f dettfting him in fuch a Maftnf f, that he 
could not poffihly derty or palliate his Guilt, was 
next his Heart. 

He refolv'd therefore to give tt out, that he 
was gone to London^ to make Lady Bella be- 
lieve it was in Obedience to her Command? 
that he had left her, with a t'urpofe riot to re- 
turn till he had cleared his Innocence ; but ia 
tcality to conceal hliSiftlf in his own Apartment, 
and fee what £fFt£b his reputed Abfence would 
()roduce. 

Having thus taken his Relblution, he fcnt 
for Mr. Koberts his Father's Steward, to whofc 
Cafe he had cntruftcd Lady Bella in her Retire- 
ment, and acquainting him with Part of his 
Apprehenfions with Regard to Sir Georgia At- 
tempts upon his Coufm ; he imparted to him 
his Dtfign of flaying concealed there, in order 
to difcover more effeftually thofe Attempts, and 
to preferve Lady Bella from any Corifequence 
t)f them. 

Mr. Roberts approved of his Dcfign 5 and af- 
fur'd him of his Vigilance and Care, both in 
concealing his Stay, and alfo in giving him No- 
. ticc of ^very Thing that pafi'd. 

Mr. GtanvilU then wrote a (hort Billet to

down his Sword, and endeavotK^d to fupport 
him s while the Lady, who had loft her Veil

His Strength failing him at thefe Words» he 
feinted away in Mr. GlanviUe^s Arms ; who tho* 
now convinced of his Treachery, was extremely 
IbockM at the Condition he (aw him in. .^ 

Mifs GlatwiUe renewing her Tears anJ Ex* 
damations at this Sight, he was obliged to lay 
Sir Georgi gently upon the Ground, and ran to 
find out fomebody to fend for a Surgeon, and 
to help him to convey him into the Houfe. 

In his Way he was met by Mr. Roberts^ who 
was coming to feek him ^ and with a Look of 
Terror and Confuiion told him. Lady B^Ila^ 
was brought Home extremely ill— that her Lifo 
had been in Danger, and that (he was but juft 
rccovei'd from a terrible fainting Fit. 

Mr. Glanville^ tho' greatly alarm'd at this 
News, forgot not to take all poffible Care of 
Sir Georgi \ diredling Roberts to get Ibme Per- 
fon to carry him into the Houfe, and giving 
him Orders to procure proper Affiflance, flew 
to Lady Bellows Apartment. 

Her Women had juft put her to Bed, raving 
as in a ftrong Delirium. Mr. GlanviUi ap- 
proached her, and finding flie W2s in a violent 
Fever, di(patch*d a Man and Horfe immedi- 
ately to Town, to get Phyficians, and to ac- 
quaint his Father with what had happened. 

Mr. RobertSy upon the Surgeon's Report that 
Sir George was not mortally wounded, came 
to inform him of this good News, but he found 
him incapable of liftning to him, and in Ago- 
nies not to be expreft. TTwas with Difficdty 
they forc'd him out of Arabella^ Chamber into 
his own ; where throwing bimfelf upon hb

be was told Sir Charles and the Phyficians were 
arriv'd. 

He then ran eageily to hear their Opinions of 
+iis beloved Cpufin, which he foon difcovePd 
by their fignificant Gcftures and half pronounced 
Words, to be very bad. They comforted him 
however, with Hopes that (he might recover, 
and infiftrng upon her being kept very quiet, 
©blig'd him to quit the Room, While all the 
neceflary Methods were taken to abate the Vio- 
lence of the Difeafe, Sir Charles^ who had been 
informed by his Steward of his Son's Duel with 
Sir George^ was amaz'd to the laft Degree at 
two fuch terrible Accidents. 

Having fccn his Son to his Chamber, and re- 
commended him to be patient and compos'd, 
he went to vifit the young Baronet, and was 
not a little furpriz'd to find his Daughter fitting 
at his Bed's Head, with all the Appearance, of 
a violent Affliftlon. 

Indeed Mife GlanvilU's Cares were fo wholly 
engrofs*d by Sir Ge&rge^Sy that {he hardly 
ever thought of her Q}ufin Arabella^ and hao 
juft (lept into her Chamber while the. Surgeons 
were dreffing Sir dorgis Wound, and renewed 
her Attendance upon him as foon as that was 
ovtr. 

Mi6 Glanville however, thought proper to 
make fome trifling Excufes to her Father fox 
her Solicitude about Sir George, And the 
young Bironet, on whom the Fear of Death 
produced its ufual EfFefts, and made him exr 
tremely concern'd for the Errors of his paft

. Sir Charles was very defirous of Icnowing the 
Occafion of his Quarrel with his Son, but Sir 
'Giorgi was too weak to hold any further Con* 
vcrfation, upon which Sir Charles^ after a A^ort 
Vifit retii'd, taking lAMiJGlariv'dU along with 
.him. 

That the Reader, whofe Imagination is no 
doubt upon the Stretch to conceive the Mcanipg 
of thcfe Two extraordinary Incidents, may l^

Kitid of Fretfulncfs and Impatience to her 
Grief; that (he refolv'd to quit them, and widi 
Lttcy^ go in queft oif the Princefi of Gauh

The Ladies however, iniifled upon her not 
leaving them i and her Excufe that (he was 
going in fearch of an unfortuiute Unknown^ 
for whom (he had vow'd a Fiiendfhip, made 
them all immediately reiblvc to accompany her, 
extremely diverted with the Oddity of the De- 
fign> and facrificing her to their Mirth by fly 
Leer«, Whifpers, ftiflcd Laughs, and a thou- 
fand little fprightly Sallies, wiiich the difconfo- 
late Arabella took no Notice of, fo deeply were 
her Thoughts engag'd. 

Tho' (he knew not which Way to direft her 
Steps, yet concluding the melancholy Cynecia 
would certainly chufe fome very folitary Place 
for her Refidence, (he rambled about among 
the leaft frequented Paths, foUow'd by the young 
Ladies, who ardently defir'd to fee this unfor- 
tunate Unknown ; tho' at Jrabella*s earned 
Requeft, they promis'd not to (hew themfelvcs 
to the Lady, yrho, (he informed them, for 
very urgent Reafons, was obligM to keep her(elf

Spirits of Arabella's Companions, they were en- 
abled to fupporjt it by t^ Diverfipn her Beha*

Arabella conftruing the Silence with which 
her Companions heard thefe AITurances, into a 
IXHibt of their being fo favpured by Fortunf, 
proceeded to inform them of feveral Inftances 
wherein Ladies met with unexpected Relief and 
Deliverance from Ravifliers. 

She mentionM particularly the R-fcue of 
Statira by her own Brother, whom (he ima- 
gin'd ftjT many Years dead ; that of tlie Prin- 
ceis Berenice by an abfolute Stranger, and many 
others, whofe Names, Chara£lers and Adveh« 
turcs {he occafionally run over ; all which the 
young Ladies heard with ineonceivaSle Afto- 
niihment. And the Detail had fuch an EfFc^ 
upon Arabella's Imagination, bewilder'd as it 
was in the Fol ics of Romances, that 'fpying 
three or four Horfemen riding along the Road 
towards them, (he immediately concluded they 
would be all feiz'd and carry M ofF. 

Po(refs'd with tbis Belief, (h« utterM a loud 
Cry, and flew to the Water- fide, which alarm-

A Boat that Inftant appearing,, he put her into

newing all her former Sufpicions, that her Cou- 
flu's Ghara s rival'd hers in his Heart, as (goii 
, as (he alighted, finding Arabella was not at

her C^ amber, revolving in her Mjnd every 
Particular of Sir George's Behaviour to her Cou-

reflecting upon the Difguife in which (he (aw

have rab'd in me a much higher Efteem for 
you. 

Yet I will not pardon you, added flie^ 
without enjoining you a Penance for the Fault 
you own you have committed ; and; this Pe- 
nance (hall be to prove, 

Firft, That thefe Hiflories you condemn 
are FiSions. 

Next, That they are abfurd. 
And L^ftly, That they are Criminal. 
The Doftor was pleas'd to find a Reconci* 
liation offer'd upon fo very cafy Terms, with 
a Perfon whom he beheld at once with Reve* 
rence and AfFtAion, and could not oiFeiul 
without extreme Regret. 

He therefore anfwered with a very chearful 
Compofure : 

To prove thofei Narratives to be FiSions, 
Madam, is only difficult, becaaie the Pofition 
is almofl too evident for Proof. 

Your Ladylhip knows, I fupp^fe to whai 
Authors thefc Writings are afcrib'd ? 

To the French Wits of the laft Century, 
faid Arabella. 

And at what Diftance, Madam, are the 
Fads related in them from the Age of the 
Writer I 

I was never exa£l in my Computation, re- 
plied AraUela \ but I think meft of the Events^ 
happened about two thoufand Years ago. 

How then. Madam, refumM the Dodor, 
could thefe Events be fo minutely known ta

$ut by what A<^d^^t» th^n, faid the Do&pr 
'{miling, did it happen thefe Records and Mo* 
numents were kept univcrfally fecret to Maiir

What brought all the Memoirs of the n> 
.moteft Nations ^nd eadieft Ages only to 
France ? 

. Where were they hidden that none could con- 
.fuk them hut a feiw obfcure Authors? 

And whither are ,thcy now. vaniihed again 
bat they can be found no more ? 

^ri7£^//ez having fat ftlent a while, told him. 
That (he found his Queftions very diiEcult to 
be anfwer'd ; and that though perhaps the Au- 
thors, themfe] yes could have told whence they 
borrowed their Materials, (he . (hould not aj: 
prefent require any other Evidence of the iirft 
A(rcrtion.: 

But allowM him to fuppofe them Fi^ion^, 
and required npw that he mould (hew tbeiii to 
be abfurd. 

Your Ladylhip, rcturn'd he, has, 1 find, 
}oo much Underftanding, to flruggle againft 
DemonAration, and too much Veracity, to der 
ny your Convi£lions ; therefore fome of the 
Arguments by which I intended to (hew the 
FaKhood of thefe Narratives may be nowufed 
to prove their Abfurdity.

You grant them. Madam, to be Fi£Hons? 

Sir, interrupted AiaheUa, cagerljr, You are 
again infringing the Laws of DIfputation. 

You are not to confound a Suppofition 
of which I allow you only the prefeht Ufr, 
with an unlimited and irrevocable Concef- 
fion. 

I am too well acquainted with my owri 
Wcaknefs to conclude an Opinion falfe, 
merely becaufe I find myfelf unable to de- 
fend it. 

But I am in haftc to hear the Proof of the 
other Pofitions, not only becaufe ftey maj 
perhaps ftipply what is deficient in your Evi- 
dence of the firft, but be^iufe I think it of 
more Importance to deteA Corruption than 
Fifiion. 

Though indeed Fallhood is a Species of Cor- 
ruption, and what Falihood is more hateful 
than the Fallhcod of Hiftory. 

Since you have drawn me back. Madam, 
to the fiift Quefiion, returned thef Doftor, 
Let me 4now. what Arguments your Lady- 
fliip can produce for the Veracity of thefe 
Books. 

That there are many Obje£tions a^'iift 
it, you yourfelf have allowed, and the high- 
efi moral Evidence of FaUhood appears when 
there are many Arguments againft an Aflertion, 
arxl none for it^ 



Sir, 



Chap. II. QUIXOTE. 313 

Sir» replied Arabella^ I fhall never think that 
any Narrative, which is not confuted by its 
own AbAirdfty, is without one Argument at 
leaft on its Side ; there is a Love of Truth in 
the human Mind, if nbt naturally imp1anted» 
fo eafily obtained flora Reafon and Expe* 
tience, that I (hould expedt it uniyerfally to 
prevail where there is no ftrong Temptation to 
Deceit j we hate to be deceived, we therefore 
bate thofe that deceive us ; we defire not to 
be hated, and therefore know that we are not 
to deceive. Shew me an equal Motive to 
Falfbood, or confefs that every Relation has 
fome Right to -Credit. 

This may be allowed. Madam, faid the Doc* 
tor, when we claim to be credited, but that 
feems not to be the Hope or Intention of thefe 
Writers. 

Surely Sir, replied Arabella^ you muft n^if- 
take their Defign ; he that writes without In* 
tention to be credited, muft write to little Pur- 
pofe ; for what Pleafure or Advantage can a- 
rife from Fads that never happened ? What 
Examples can be afforded by the Patience 
of thofe who never fufiered, or the Chaftity of 
thofe who were never folicited ? The great 
End of Hiftory, is to (hew how much human 
Nature can endure or perform. When we 
hear a Story in common Life that raifes our 
Wonder or CompaiEon, the firft Confutation 
ftills our Emotions, and however we were 
touched before, we then chafe it Ixom the Me^ 
mory with Contempt as a Trifle, or with In- 
dignation as an Impofturc. Prove, thereforet 
that the Books which I have hitherto read as

I do not wonder, that what Vehemence the

The Fables o^ Mfopy faid Arahilla^ are a- 
mong ihofe of which the Abfurdity difcovers 
itfelf, and the Truth i3 comprifed in the Ap- 
plication ; but; what can be faid of thofe Taks 
which are told with the folemn Air of hiftori- 
Cal Truth, and if falfe convey no Inftruftion ? 

That they cannot be defended Madam, faid 
theDoftor, it is my Purpofe to prove, and if to 
^aeindc their FaKhood be fufficient to procure 
their Banifhment from your Ladyfhip's Cloler, 
their Day of Grace is near an end. How is 
any oral, or written Teftimony, confuted or 
confirmed ? 

By comparing it, fays the Lady, with the 
Teftimony of others, or with the natural Ef- 
feds and ftanding Evidence of the Fadts rela- 
ted, and fometimes by comparing it with itfelf. 

if then your Ladyfhip will abide by this laft, ' 
returned he, and compare thefe &3oks with 
ancient Hiftories, you will not only find innu- 
merable Names, of which no ^Iention was 
ever made before, but Perfons who lived in 
diflerent Ages, engaged as the Friends or Ri- 
vals of each other. You will perceive that 
your Authors have parcelled out the World at 
Difcretion, eredled Palaces, and cftabliflicd 
Monarchies wherever the Conveniency of 
iheir Narrative required them, and fet kings 
and Queens over imaginary Nations. Nor have 
they confidered themfelves as inveftcd with lefs 
Authority over the Works of Nature, than the 
Inltitutions of Men; for they have diftributed 
Mountains and Defarts, Gulphs and Rocks, 
wherever they wanted them, and whenever the 
Courfe of their Slory required an Expedient,

The only Excellence of Fallbood, anfwere4 
he, is its Refemblance Co Truth j as therefore 
any Narrative is mpre liable to be confuted bf 
its Inconfiftency with known Fa€b» it is at a 
greater Diftance from the Perfedion of Fic^ 
lion ; for there can be no Difikulty in framing 
a Tale, if we are left at Liberty to invert aft 
Hiftory and Nature for our own Conveniency* 
When a Crime is to be concealed, it is esiff 
to cover it with an imaginary Word. When 
Virtue is to be rewarded, a Nation with 
a new Name may, without . any Ex- 
nence of Invention, raife her to the Throne,

ferve, refamed he, that thefe Books foften the 
Heart to Love, and harden it, to Murder, 
that they teach Women to exaft Ven- 
geance, andMen to execute it; teach Women to 
ezpeft not only Worfhip, but. the dteadful 
Worlhip of human Sacrifices. Every Page of 
thefe Volumes is filled with fuch extravagance 
of Praife, and exprefEons of Obedience as one 
human Being ought not to hear from another ; 
or withAccountsofBatt]es,in which thoufaxlds 
are flaughtered for lio other Purpofe than to 
gain a Smile from the haughty Beauty, who 
Ifits a calm Spedbtrefs of the Ruin and De- 
folation, Bloodfhed and Mifeiy, incited by 
berfelf. 

It isimpoifible to read thefe Tales with 
out leflening part of that Humility, which 
by preferving in us a Senfe of our Alliance 
with all human nature, keeps us awake toTen- 
demefs and Sympathy, or without impairing 
that Companion which is implanted in us as 
an Incentive to h&& of Kindnefs. If there be 
any preferved by natural Softnefs, or early 
Education from learning Pride and Cruelty, 
they are yet in danger of being betrayed to the 
Vanity of Beauty, and taught the Arts of 
/fltrigue.

of fome COTifcquence. Six, Charles no ioon^ 
mentioned this Requeft, than Arabella zixtt

had been 'kept a Stranger to ali tlie Particulars 
of Mr Glanville's Quarrels with the young 
Baronet, her Thoughts were a little perplex'd 
concerning the Occafion of this Vifit, and 
her Embarrafsment was confiderably increafed 
by the Confulion whith fhe perceived in the 
Countenance of Sir George. It was not 
without fome Tokens of a painfully fuppreft 
Reluctance that Sir Geerge confented to per- 
form his Promife, when Mr Glanville claimed 
it, but the Difadvantages that would attend 
his Breach of it, dejeded and humbled as he 
now was, prefenting themfelves in a forcible 
manner to his Imagination, confirmed his 
wavering Refolutions. And fince he found 
himfelf obliged to be his own Accufer, he en-, 
deavoured to do it with the beft Grace he 
could. Acknowledging therefore to Lady 
Bella all the Artifices her Deception by Ro-

ufe upon her, and explaining very explicitly 
the la ft with relation to the pretended Princete

as for the Trouble it had formerly.
